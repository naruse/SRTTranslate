[music]

5
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,081
So...?

6
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,957
Well, professor, I was hoping I could talk to you about your research?

7
00:02:50,165 --> 00:02:55,582
What for? It's all on my webpage.

8
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,165
Yeah...

9
00:02:58,498 --> 00:03:00,249
Well, sir, I'm a first-year masters student,

10
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,831
and I was hoping I could do a Ph.D. in your research area--

11
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:05,039
And you want me to fund you and be your thesis advisor.

12
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:09,582
Yeah, uh, here's all the work I've done.  As you can see, I have some ideas--

13
00:03:09,915 --> 00:03:13,831
Yeah. Listen, let me tell you how this works.

14
00:03:14,165 --> 00:03:16,708
Being a Ph.D. student, working with an professor,

15
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:19,039
it's a lot like a marriage.

16
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,708
Whole thing typically lasts five to seven years,

17
00:03:22,207 --> 00:03:24,207
fifty percent of them end in a bitter divorce,

18
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,624
and it all culminates in a big ceremony

19
00:03:27,873 --> 00:03:32,414
where you walk down the aisle wearing a fancy gown.

20
00:03:33,873 --> 00:03:36,915
But sir, I--, I joined this program specifically to work in your research group.

21
00:03:37,165 --> 00:03:39,081
I mean, I graduated at the top of my class--

22
00:03:39,414 --> 00:03:42,000
Well that's nice-- So did the other seven master's students

23
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:44,249
waiting outside my door right now.

24
00:03:44,498 --> 00:03:47,375
You're in the upper echelons of academia now.

25
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:49,750
Very few make it to the top.

26
00:03:50,165 --> 00:03:51,873
Like a pyramid scheme?

27
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:56,081
Well it is pyramidal in shape, yes.

28
00:03:56,456 --> 00:03:58,123
This may sound cruel, but we in academia,

29
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:02,915
we stand at the cutting edge between humanity and the great abyss.

30
00:04:03,249 --> 00:04:05,123
Between ignorance and truth.

31
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,540
Who else are you going to trust to tell you the difference?

32
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,207
The politicians?

33
00:04:09,498 --> 00:04:12,831
Wall Street? The media?  Please.

34
00:04:13,249 --> 00:04:15,750
Well, but sir, what if I can't find a professor who will take me?

35
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,207
If you're that desperate to work in a lab,

36
00:04:19,498 --> 00:04:22,375
I suppose our floors could use a good mopping.

37
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,750
Well I mean, what if I don't make it as  Ph. D. student? What am I gonna do?

38
00:04:25,249 --> 00:04:26,789
I don't have a backup plan.

39
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:31,291
I suppose you could try, uh, a lesser institution?

40
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,750
MIT, perhaps?

41
00:04:34,249 --> 00:04:36,000
What I'm saying is,

42
00:04:36,249 --> 00:04:38,081
maybe you should look around a little.

43
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:43,750
[music]

44
00:04:44,873 --> 00:04:46,624
Morning, Tajel!

45
00:04:46,873 --> 00:04:50,249
Hey, Cecilia-- Goodness gracious, what are you wearing?

46
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,414
What, this?  It's my favorite shirt!  I got it free my freshman year.

47
00:04:53,873 --> 00:04:55,873
It reminds me of a simpler time,

48
00:04:56,333 --> 00:05:00,291
of my dream to come to grad school and make a difference with my research.

49
00:05:00,624 --> 00:05:02,123
So, what happened to that dream?

50
00:05:02,414 --> 00:05:05,207
It's stained and crumbling, kinda like this shirt.

51
00:05:05,498 --> 00:05:07,207
Are you going to a rally?

52
00:05:07,498 --> 00:05:10,291
Yes.  Today we're protesting poor living conditions

53
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,414
for an underprivileged and exploited minority.

54
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:14,498
Sounds serious.  Who is it?

55
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:15,873
Us! Graduate students!

56
00:05:16,165 --> 00:05:18,165
Did you know that it pays more to work at McDonalds

57
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,498
than to get a Ph.D. from a major university?

58
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:22,498
Wow.  Is that true?

59
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,750
Totally.  I read it on Wikipedia.

60
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,249
Hey!  Today's my first day as a teaching assistant for Professor Chu's class.

61
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,456
Oh really? I thought you were fully funded already.

62
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:34,123
True, I don't have to TA, but I'm really excited about it.

63
00:05:34,582 --> 00:05:36,582
I watched Dead Poet's Society last night for inspiration.

64
00:05:36,957 --> 00:05:38,957
You know that movie doesn't end well.

65
00:05:39,456 --> 00:05:42,081
That's why I came to grad school--to make a difference,

66
00:05:42,456 --> 00:05:44,123
to challenge young minds and inspire them.

67
00:05:44,456 --> 00:05:46,873
Anyways, at least it'll look good when I apply for faculty positions.

68
00:05:47,249 --> 00:05:51,873
They value teaching experience...right?

69
00:05:52,207 --> 00:05:55,456
Maybe it's time for a new shirt.

70

[sighs]  [music]

73
00:06:44,123 --> 00:06:47,333
Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late.  The last meeting I was at ran over a little bit.

74
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,414
I'm really sorry.

75
00:06:49,873 --> 00:06:51,873
I'm so happy to meet you.  Can you tell me about yourself?

76
00:06:52,414 --> 00:06:57,039
Oh, uh, Professor, I was hoping that I could talk to you about your research?

77
00:06:57,414 --> 00:06:58,249
Okay.   Good.

78
00:06:58,498 --> 00:06:59,831
Yeah, I've-- um, I--, I was hoping that--

79
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:02,039
"[phone rings]
-- maybe we might be able to --"

80
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:04,249
Marcy!  You know I'm in a meeting.

81
00:07:04,498 --> 00:07:08,000
Oh, ok.  Ohh, D. C. tomorrow!  Ok.  Just a moment.

82
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,831
Okay.

83
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,291
I don't have time!

84
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,249
"Oh!  Right!  Yes, I'll be right there.
[music]"

85
00:07:22,915 --> 00:07:26,582
Welcome everybody.  I'm Professor Chu.

86
00:07:26,831 --> 00:07:32,165
For this class, your T. A. is Cecilia,

87
00:07:32,624 --> 00:07:34,624
one of my best and brightest students!

88
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:39,498
She is being considered for a faculty position at Berkeley right now.

89
00:07:42,498 --> 00:07:47,873
Ok.  Computer Science:  how did we get away with calling it science?

90
00:07:48,831 --> 00:07:52,582
Um, hello Professor.  Um, uh, I was taking a look

91
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,333
at some of your papers, and I think that I might...

92
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,498
...be able...uh...

93
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,081
Who are you?

94
00:08:01,456 --> 00:08:03,456
Oh, I'm uh-- I'm uh, a grad student--

95
00:08:03,456 --> 00:08:05,165
[loud snoring]

96
00:08:05,873 --> 00:08:07,873
...and I, uh...

97
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:13,414
Back in my days, we did not have sixty-four bits.

98
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:17,957
Not even six bits.  We barely had one bit.

99
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:22,123
And, we did all experiments--everything!--with zero only.

100
00:08:22,456 --> 00:08:27,249
And, it upsampled both ways, left and right.

101
00:08:27,624 --> 00:08:29,624
Yes, I would love to take you as my Ph. D. student.

102
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:31,915
Really?

103
00:08:32,249 --> 00:08:35,249
Absolutely.  Your coursework and experience are perfect for my research interests.

104
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,333
Well that, uh, that's great.  I cannot tell you how hard--

105
00:08:38,915 --> 00:08:40,582
Unfortunately, I just got denied tenure.

106
00:08:40,915 --> 00:08:41,789
What?

107
00:08:42,123 --> 00:08:44,123
They're kicking me out!  I guess getting published

108
00:08:44,456 --> 00:08:46,456
in the journal Science and landing a fifteen-million-dollar contract

109
00:08:46,831 --> 00:08:48,414
isn't enough around here.

110
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,414
But--

111
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,414
Ok, granted, it was only the Letters section, and I was

112
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:53,915
the fourteenth co-author on that grant.

113
00:08:54,249 --> 00:08:55,957
Anyways, I'm moving to the middle of the country

114
00:08:56,249 --> 00:08:57,957
to work for a third-tier institution.

115
00:08:58,249 --> 00:08:59,957
I can bring you with me if you like!

116
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:02,207
Um...?

117
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,624
Uh, Miss T. A.?

118
00:09:07,957 --> 00:09:09,750
Oh, just call me Cecilia.

119
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,666
Uh, yeah.  Hey, can I get an extension?

120
00:09:12,957 --> 00:09:14,750
On what?

121
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,249
The homework...

122
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,540
We haven't assigned any yet.  It's the first day of class.

123
00:09:19,873 --> 00:09:26,165
Oh, um, then can I get an extension on the extension?

124
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:30,039
I suppose... Why?  Is something the matter?

125
00:09:30,456 --> 00:09:34,831
Uhh...well, I'm just kind of, uh...

126
00:09:35,456 --> 00:09:37,456
...super busy right now.  I've got, uh, classes and stuff.

127
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,333
Yeah, of course.  No problem.  I'm here to help you guys.

128
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,039
"Oh captain, my captain!"

129
00:09:50,414 --> 00:09:52,414
Yeah.

130
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,333
Hey, uh, can I get an extension?

131
00:10:00,123 --> 00:10:02,123
I guess--are you super busy too?

132
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,750
Yeah, kinda.  My boyfriend just proposed to me!

133
00:10:05,624 --> 00:10:06,750
And we all went out to celebrate.

134
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,750
So now I'm way too excited to go to class.

135
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:10,582
Uh, okay.

136
00:10:10,915 --> 00:10:12,915
Cool, thanks!

137
00:10:13,957 --> 00:10:18,249
Can I also maybe get an extension because I am very very very hungry...

138
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:29,540
Hey, Dad.  Yeah, uh, grad school's going...great.

139
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:33,582
Yeah, I'm actually doing an independent study for a professor.

140
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:39,414
It's called, "Workspace Augmentation of Photon Impingement Through Impurities Removal"

141
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:43,081
Technically, it means that I'm paying the university

142
00:10:43,456 --> 00:10:45,333
to do free work for them.

143
00:10:45,582 --> 00:10:48,165
Yeah, but Professor Smith says that if I do a good job

144
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,957
he might tentatively consider possibly thinking about

145
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:53,249
taking me on as a Ph. D. student.

146
00:10:53,915 --> 00:10:58,291
How long before I finish my Ph. D.?

147
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,540
Uh, well... Yeah, yeah, I know you told all your friends

148
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,456
I was gonna be a doctor.

149
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,750
You didn't tell them I was gonna be a medical doctor, did you?

150
00:11:10,498 --> 00:11:27,540

[commotion inside]

153
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,750
"Yeah?
--Are you Mike Slackenerny?"

154
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,831
Maybe--who's asking?

155
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,498
I'm a new student with Professor Smith's lab

156
00:11:49,831 --> 00:11:51,414
and they told me to come talk to you?

157
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:53,708
Ah, new guy.  Hold a sec.

158
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,666
Let's go.

159
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,831
Okay, the first lesson in being a Ph. D. student

160
00:12:19,165 --> 00:12:22,414
is learning about the most important thing in a Ph.D. student's life.

161
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,249
It surrounds us, it binds us,

162
00:12:26,249 --> 00:12:30,333
flows through us, and gives us life.

163
00:12:30,873 --> 00:12:32,414
You mean, the Force?

164
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,414
The free food!

165
00:12:37,873 --> 00:12:40,333
Okay, act casual.

166
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,789
Is this food for us?

167
00:12:48,123 --> 00:12:49,666
Nah, it's for the Special Relativity Seminar,

168
00:12:49,957 --> 00:12:51,540
but they're always losing track of time.

169
00:12:51,873 --> 00:12:53,831
You want some?

170
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,123
No thanks.

171
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:58,915
You see, free food's about a lot more than just getting a free meal.

172
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,291
It's about opportunity,

173
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,873
and how you're wasting it coming to grad school

174
00:13:04,123 --> 00:13:06,123
instead of getting a real job and earning a decent living.

175
00:13:06,456 --> 00:13:07,831
Did you know there are over

176
00:13:08,165 --> 00:13:09,957
five thousand janitors in this country with a Ph. D.?

177
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:13,708
So you might as well eat the free food--am I right?

178
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,291
Welcome to the Smith Lab.

[angelic choir music]

180
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,081
Uh, don't I need a labcoat?

181
00:13:38,414 --> 00:13:40,414
Suit yourself.

182
00:13:50,582 --> 00:13:53,039
So, do you feel more science-y now?

183
00:13:53,456 --> 00:13:55,291
Yeah, I picked the only labcoat that seems clean.

184
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,750
Ah, that's Professor Smith's.

185
00:13:58,207 --> 00:14:00,123
Won't he need it when he works at the lab, though?

[laughter]

187
00:14:04,498 --> 00:14:06,249
Oh man.  Let me introduce you around the group.

00:14:06,498 --> 00:14:07,666
That's Carlos.

'Sup.

00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,123
That's Deva.  He already has a Ph. D. from his home country,

191
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,375
but the only job he could get there was as a taxi driver.

That's Sean, but everybody calls him Golden Boy.

194
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:22,456
Guys, I keep telling you--I'm not Professor Smith's favorite.

195
00:14:22,789 --> 00:14:24,375
Ask him what he did last weekend.

196
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,831
I went hiking with Professor Smith.

197
00:14:27,165 --> 00:14:28,249
What?

198
00:14:28,498 --> 00:14:31,957
And that's Allison.  She's #2 on the lab hierarchy.

199
00:14:32,249 --> 00:14:35,039
Basically, I do all the crap around here nobody else wants to do.

200
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,498
The lab motto is:

201
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:38,291
"Why do something today,

202
00:14:38,582 --> 00:14:41,708
when you can get Allison to do it for you tomorrow?"

203
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,375
So, uh, how's your research going?

204
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:51,249
Don't you know you're never supposed to ask a grad student that question?

205
00:14:51,831 --> 00:14:53,708
It's just rude.

206
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Uh, how's your thesis going?

207
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:03,123
Come on, why don't you just ask her weight and age while you're at it? Gosh!

208
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:09,915
This is the fume hood, a.k.a. the community storage closet.

209
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:14,375
That chemical will kill you instantly.

210
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,582
That one will kill you eventually.

211
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:21,540
That one will dissolve all the bones in your body.

212
00:15:22,414 --> 00:15:27,498
And don't even look at that one if you're ever planning on having kids.

213
00:15:27,831 --> 00:15:33,414
And those two--uh-oh--should not be that close together.

And this is The Machine.

[scary music]

216
00:15:47,456 --> 00:15:50,333
I've always wanted to work on the cutting edge of technology.

217
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,333
It was cutting edge when I started.

218
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,333
Why waste a million dollars on a newer model

219
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:57,375
when it's cheaper to just waste a million grad student hours?

220
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,456
Which brings us to our business.

221
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:02,624
Professor Smith has asked me to teach you how to use it,

222
00:16:03,165 --> 00:16:04,873
but I have to warn you, learning to use it

223
00:16:05,249 --> 00:16:06,831
will make you more indispensable to the lab,

224
00:16:07,165 --> 00:16:09,165
but it will also make everyone else come to you with their projects.

225
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,708
Do you accept this great responsibility?

226
00:16:13,123 --> 00:16:14,624
I do.

227
00:16:14,915 --> 00:16:19,915
Ok, well, here is the manual.

228
00:16:23,207 --> 00:16:24,831
That's it?

229
00:16:25,207 --> 00:16:28,750
Okay, you want to know the real secret to making this thing work?

230
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,414
It took my first decade in grad school to figure that out.

231
00:16:35,207 --> 00:16:38,291
So, congratulations.  Here is your immunity idol.

232
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,333
You can't get kicked off the island now.

233
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,666
Welcome to the Lab.

Do you have any more advice?

Yeah, don't go for your Ph. D.

"Hey, Cecilia!
-- Hi!"

240
00:17:07,873 --> 00:17:09,873
Would you like to dance?

241
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,333
Looks like you need some help.

242
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,249
Oh.

243
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,540
Thanks.

244
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,207
Actually, I don't really know how to dance this.

245
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,375
Ah, well, it's easy. It's the triple step.

246
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,666
You take three steps in syncopation.

247
00:17:40,915 --> 00:17:42,081
Syncopation?

248
00:17:42,414 --> 00:17:45,039
It just means quickly.  So you start with your left foot forward.

249
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,540
"Your left?
-- Uh-huh, always the left"

250
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:50,498
Forward, back, now cha cha cha.

251
00:17:51,831 --> 00:17:53,831
Forward, back, cha cha cha!

252
00:17:54,456 --> 00:17:55,666
Forward, back--

253
00:17:55,957 --> 00:17:57,708
"Cha cha cha!
-- There you go!"

254
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,831
I take it you're not a regular at the club?

255
00:18:00,081 --> 00:18:02,624
No, this is the first time.  Can you tell?

256
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,915
Well, it's just a practice session.

257
00:18:05,249 --> 00:18:06,915
We're really gearing up for the big competition next term.

258
00:18:07,249 --> 00:18:09,249
Wow, I didn't know it was so popular.

259
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,750
Actually, I read a study once that said that people who are normally

260
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,039
more uncomfortable in social situations really love ballroom dancing.

261
00:18:15,456 --> 00:18:17,456
It's a more structured form of interaction.

262
00:18:17,915 --> 00:18:20,081
There's an agreed-upon set of rules, and if you follow them,

263
00:18:20,414 --> 00:18:22,873
you're pretty much guaranteed not to embarrass yourself.

264
00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:25,039
And what are these rules?

265
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:28,249
First of all, if someone asks you to dance, you shouldn't say no.

266
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,873
Also, you can't ask the same person to dance twice in a row.

267
00:18:32,414 --> 00:18:36,039
And, you have an out.  When the song stops, the dance is over.

268
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:40,750
They don't play tracks continuously like they do at other clubs

269
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,291
Doesn't 'syncopation' mean 'out of sync'?

270
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:50,414
Uh, no.  It just means 'unexpected.'

271
00:18:52,873 --> 00:18:55,750
Oh, I think I have to dance with someone else now.

272
00:18:56,498 --> 00:18:59,414
Oh, well, there is a loophole to the rule.

273
00:18:59,873 --> 00:19:01,165
Oh there is?

274
00:19:01,456 --> 00:19:04,873
If I ask you to dance, it's not the same as you asking me twice.

275
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,333
I'd love to.

276
00:19:08,249 --> 00:19:12,789
Oh, there's the rumba.  Maybe we should just watch this one.

277
00:19:21,207 --> 00:19:24,831
People always talk about the tango in ballroom dance,

278
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:29,039
but I think the rumba's much more interesting.

279
00:19:30,915 --> 00:19:34,540
It's about the point in the relationship when two lovers are frustrated.

280
00:19:35,165 --> 00:19:39,207
They love each other, but they can't stand each other.

281
00:19:40,081 --> 00:19:41,831
See how they push and pull?

282
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:45,333
There's so much longing and angst in their movement.

283
00:19:46,249 --> 00:19:50,249
Besides, look at it.  It's so beautiful.

284
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:56,582
The key to dancing is finding the right impedance match between two partners.

285
00:19:57,291 --> 00:20:01,750
It's about not losing momentum.

286
00:20:02,456 --> 00:20:04,456
It's about finding the right resonant frequencies,

287
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:09,249
close enough to each other, so that you don't lose energy.

Oh, you know, losing momentum.

321
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,375
The good news is that we've been invited to submit a paper

322
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:17,915
to a prestigious conference in Hawaii.

323
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:19,831
Yes!

324
00:22:20,249 --> 00:22:23,498
The bad news is that one of you is going to have to write that paper.

325
00:22:24,123 --> 00:22:27,039
And the deadline is tonight.

326
00:22:27,414 --> 00:22:31,414
Also, I'll be the one going to Hawaii, not you.

327
00:22:32,414 --> 00:22:34,123
So I guess the good news only applies to me.

328
00:22:34,414 --> 00:22:36,666
So, I'd like to remind everyone

329
00:22:37,165 --> 00:22:40,750
that the symposium we're hosting is now only a month away.

330
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:43,375
Everyone in our field will be coming to campus,

331
00:22:44,207 --> 00:22:46,207
well, at least the ones I invited,

332
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:49,498
and that includes representatives from all of the agencies

333
00:22:49,915 --> 00:22:51,375
that fund our work.

334
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:54,123
So, I'll expect to see all of you from now on in the lab

335
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,414
working nights and weekends.

336
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,039
In addition to days and weekdays.

337
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:02,291
What about holidays?

338
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,540
Holidays are only for normal people.

339
00:23:05,123 --> 00:23:07,123
Anyone who considers themselves only normal,

340
00:23:08,414 --> 00:23:11,000
you're welcome to find another research group.

341
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,540
So--

342
00:23:13,915 --> 00:23:15,915
How's research?

343
00:23:17,081 --> 00:23:19,624
Avoid eye contact!

344
00:23:21,624 --> 00:23:22,873
You!

345
00:23:23,249 --> 00:23:25,123
I don't remember your name right at the moment,

346
00:23:25,414 --> 00:23:27,000
but tell me how your research is going.

347
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:29,333
Oh, I, um--, uhh, well--

348
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:37,333
Well, I've been trying to, uh, develop an analytical formulation

349
00:23:38,456 --> 00:23:40,456
for-- [loud snoring] ...that thing I was working on, but--

350
00:23:41,915 --> 00:23:45,123
[snoring continues] ...the problem is... that...

351
00:23:52,123 --> 00:23:53,831
I'm still waiting!

352
00:23:54,123 --> 00:23:58,207
Oh, well, see, I don't really know what to do about the boundary conditions, because well...

353
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,915
Oh! Before I forget,

354
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:05,498
there's a large amount of money in our discretionary budget

355
00:24:05,915 --> 00:24:08,414
that we need to spend.  Otherwise, we lose it.

356
00:24:09,582 --> 00:24:12,291
Any suggestions?

357
00:24:13,624 --> 00:24:15,414
Uh, you could give us raises?

358
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,750
I said spend the money, not waste it.

359
00:24:19,165 --> 00:24:20,873
We could get a new lab fridge?

360
00:24:21,081 --> 00:24:22,375
What's wrong with the current one?

361
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,831
[alarms sounding]

362
00:24:26,873 --> 00:24:28,333
They're threatening to come with HazMat suits and remove it.

363
00:24:29,123 --> 00:24:31,123
[sighs]

364
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:36,957
Uh, we could use it to update the machine I'm using?

365
00:24:41,165 --> 00:24:43,165
Okay.  Do it.

366
00:24:44,957 --> 00:24:46,789
But I'll expect groundbreaking results in time for the symposium.

367
00:24:47,123 --> 00:24:49,123
Yes.

368
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,750
Or else.  I'll be coming by in a few weeks for a demonstration.

369
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:04,498
Beware the Negation Field...

370
00:25:05,582 --> 00:25:27,582
[music]

371
00:25:34,456 --> 00:26:00,456
[music]

372
00:26:04,291 --> 00:26:07,456
[knocking]  I'm looking for CS 101 office hours?

373
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:09,249
That's me!

374
00:26:09,498 --> 00:26:11,498
Sweet.

375
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:14,333
I need help with the homework.

376
00:26:14,582 --> 00:26:16,000
Of course.  That's why I'm here.

377
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:18,000
Uh, what did you have trouble with?

378
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:19,831
All of it.

379
00:26:20,165 --> 00:26:21,789
Okay, uh, let's see what you got.

380
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,039
I haven't actually done any of it.

381
00:26:24,873 --> 00:26:26,375
Oh.

382
00:26:26,666 --> 00:26:28,414
I tried Problem 1.

383
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:30,582
Okay, well what did you do in this problem?

384
00:26:30,831 --> 00:26:32,750
I did Problem 1.

385
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,750
I know that. Uh, what's this number that you have here?

386
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,333
That's a seven.

387
00:26:39,582 --> 00:26:42,456
I can see it's a seven.  How did you compute it?

388
00:26:43,123 --> 00:26:44,666
I--, I used the formula.

389
00:26:44,957 --> 00:26:46,666
The formula for what?

390
00:26:46,957 --> 00:26:48,957
For Problem 1.

391
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:52,789
Yes, but what does that formula compute?

392
00:26:54,414 --> 00:26:56,333
Seven?

393
00:26:56,624 --> 00:26:58,123
Seven what?

394
00:26:58,414 --> 00:27:00,414
Seven...point zero?

395
00:27:01,915 --> 00:27:03,915
I mean, what units?

396
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,375
Meters?

397
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,666
That would violate the laws of physics.

398
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,582
Hertz.

399
00:27:10,873 --> 00:27:13,207
Okay.  How did you compute seven hertz?

400
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:17,831
Well, you put the numbers into it and that's what you get.

401
00:27:18,624 --> 00:27:21,207
But what does it represent?

402
00:27:22,081 --> 00:27:24,666
The answer?

403
00:27:25,081 --> 00:27:27,081
But why did you get that answer?

404
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:29,333
Because the problem asked for it.

405
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,582
Aren't you supposed to help me?

406
00:27:31,915 --> 00:27:33,456
[knocking]

407
00:27:33,915 --> 00:27:36,333
Um, hi.  I forgot to get the lecture in handout today?

408
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:41,123
I mean, I forgot to get the handout in lecture today.

409
00:27:45,249 --> 00:27:47,123
Is the answer seven?

410
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,000
I can't tell you that directly.

411
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:52,207
Is it true you're going to Berkeley to become a professor?

412
00:27:52,498 --> 00:27:55,165
Uhh, yeah.  It looks like it.

413
00:27:56,123 --> 00:28:01,249
Uh, ok, ok.  Is fourteen the answer times two?

414
00:28:02,708 --> 00:28:06,957
How 'bout, touch your nose if the answer is seven,

415
00:28:08,081 --> 00:28:12,873
and pull your ear if it's thirty-two.

416
00:28:14,123 --> 00:28:16,789
"Is this gonna be on the test?
-- It might."

417
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,540
"Will the test be on a curve?
-- Maybe."

418
00:28:18,873 --> 00:28:20,789
"Will I need to know this formula?
-- That would be advisable."

419
00:28:21,081 --> 00:28:23,498
Yeah, I seriously don't understand why I even need to know this stuff.

420
00:28:23,831 --> 00:28:27,414
I'm pre-med.  I'm gonna be, you know, a real doctor.

421
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,081
The fact that real human lives are gonna depend on you one day

422
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,540
really scares me.

423
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,873
Can I...

424
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:36,915
...have...

425
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:39,123
...an extension?

426
00:28:39,414 --> 00:28:40,873
[frustrated sigh]

427
00:28:42,000 --> 00:29:16,498
[music]

428
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:20,456
"Aargh!
Why? Why am I doing this?"

429
00:29:20,831 --> 00:29:23,375
I have a college degree.  A monkey could do this!

430
00:29:24,081 --> 00:29:28,081
You know, in my country, they torture people with something very similar.

431
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,414
Guys, guys, research is torture.

432
00:29:31,789 --> 00:29:34,165
They're trying to get the truth out of you.

433
00:29:34,456 --> 00:29:36,831
All of us, we were once like you,

434
00:29:37,249 --> 00:29:40,624
young, ambitions, excited about changing the world with our research.

435
00:29:41,249 --> 00:29:42,831
And now?

436
00:29:43,249 --> 00:29:45,249
And now, the highlight of our week is drinking free beer...

437
00:29:45,582 --> 00:29:48,000
while talking to the same people we've been talking to all week.

438
00:29:48,498 --> 00:29:54,498
It's happy hour! [music]

439
00:29:55,624 --> 00:29:58,414
Okay, let me explain the basic cliques around here.

440
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:01,414
Over there, you've got your third years.

441
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,498
They only care about qualifying exams.

442
00:30:05,081 --> 00:30:07,081
Then you have the departmental staff.

443
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:10,207
You want to be nice to them.

444
00:30:11,165 --> 00:30:14,123
Then, you got your cool grad students,

445
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,957
the bitter post-docs,

446
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:19,915
and then, there's Aaron.

447
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:23,039
He's not cutting his beard 'til he finishes his thesis.

448
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:26,375
My girlfriend left me.

449
00:30:27,081 --> 00:30:31,666
And then there's the faculty, with the first- and second-years schmoozing up to them.

450
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,750
It's like high school.

451
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,582
Yes, but with much bigger egos.

452
00:30:36,873 --> 00:30:40,000
Whoa.  Is that Professor Smith's wife?

453
00:30:40,414 --> 00:30:42,789
She looks so nice.  Cheerful.

454
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:45,123
They say opposites attract.

455
00:30:45,414 --> 00:30:47,414
Maybe she's a robot.

456
00:30:48,456 --> 00:30:51,291
Guys, I heard Professor Smith used to work in the circus.

457
00:30:51,456 --> 00:30:53,456
"What!?
-- It's true!"

458
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,249
I heard it from one of the older grad students.

459
00:30:55,498 --> 00:30:57,123
And how did he know?

460
00:30:57,414 --> 00:30:59,498
He heard it from one of the grad students before him?

461
00:30:59,831 --> 00:31:04,039
Professor Smith:  the most unverifyably interesting man in the world!

462
00:31:06,873 --> 00:31:08,582
Hey, you guys talking about Brian?

463
00:31:08,915 --> 00:31:10,831
You call him by his first name?

464
00:31:11,123 --> 00:31:13,123
What?  That's how he signs his emails.

465
00:31:13,498 --> 00:31:16,414
Doesn't he sign his first name on your emails?

466
00:31:17,165 --> 00:31:20,375
Well, he's just kinda standing there, so I'm gonna go say something to him.

467
00:31:21,873 --> 00:31:24,957
Schmooze away.  Good luck!

468
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:38,708
Nice weather we've been having, Professor Smith, huh?

469
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:43,123
Small talk is for small minds.

470
00:31:46,123 --> 00:31:48,123
How's the project I assigned you going?

471
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:50,789
Uh, slowly?

472
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,540
It'll be ready in time for the symposium.

473
00:31:54,165 --> 00:31:56,165
Yeah, uh, of course.

474
00:31:57,456 --> 00:31:59,831
You know the difference between those who succeed in academia

475
00:32:00,081 --> 00:32:02,000
and those who don't?

476
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:04,957
"Uhh...
-- It's ambition."

477
00:32:05,414 --> 00:32:07,414
You either have it,

478
00:32:08,207 --> 00:32:10,207
or you don't.

479
00:32:11,582 --> 00:32:13,375
Say, do you play squash?

480
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:15,708
"Squash?
-- I need a new partner."

481
00:32:16,123 --> 00:32:20,249
"Well, I--

Hopefully you can dodge a racquet better than my last partner.

483
00:32:26,207 --> 00:32:29,000
Honey, I just saw the time.  I think the kids are waiting for us.

484
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:35,000
Well, I think I've suffered enough happiness this hour.  I'll go get the car.

485
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:40,789
I'm, uh, one of Professor Smith's grad students.

486
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,333
You know, Brian talks about you all the time.

487
00:32:43,582 --> 00:32:45,123
He does?

488
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:48,957
Well, not really.  He's very bad at names.

489
00:32:50,207 --> 00:32:52,666
Don't let him fool you.

490
00:32:53,123 --> 00:32:57,249
He was once a graduate student too.

491
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:01,789
She is not a robot!

You're playing squash with Professor Smith?

494
00:33:32,873 --> 00:33:35,708
Man, I wish I had that kind of relationship with Professor Smith.

495
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:40,000
Brown-nosers!

496
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:43,789
Don't let these babies with daddy issues distract you

497
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:46,165
from what's really important:

498
00:33:46,375 --> 00:33:47,624
"Losing.
-- What?"

499
00:33:47,915 --> 00:33:49,915
Do not let Professor Smith lose.

500
00:33:51,249 --> 00:33:53,249
Do not let him lose.

501
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,540
[toilet flushing]

502
00:33:57,915 --> 00:33:59,915
Oh, hold this.

503
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,789
That's not yours, is it?

00:34:04,081 --> 00:34:07,456
"Uh, no.
-- That's too bad. It's actually pretty good."

505
00:34:08,915 --> 00:34:11,624
So, you ready for a little friendly, gentlemanly competition?

506
00:34:11,915 --> 00:34:13,915
[boxing bell rings]

507
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:16,165
Did you know that squash was invented by monks

508
00:34:16,414 --> 00:34:18,666
in the twelfth century in France?

509
00:34:18,873 --> 00:34:20,873
Here, help me stretch.

510
00:34:21,831 --> 00:34:24,165
They used leather gloves with webbing between the fingers

511
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:26,624
and sticks to swat the ball around.

512
00:34:26,915 --> 00:34:29,873
It was further developed by prison inmates in the eighteenth century.

513
00:34:30,165 --> 00:34:33,249
There's not much to do when you're surrounded by four walls with no windows.

514
00:34:34,414 --> 00:34:37,291
Is that why labs are always in the basement?

515
00:34:37,498 --> 00:34:40,414
So, do you want to play by British Traditional or World Squash Federation rules?

516
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:44,165
Either's fine.

517
00:34:44,456 --> 00:34:46,456
Ok.  Don't go easy on me now just because I'm your advisor.

518
00:34:46,831 --> 00:34:48,831
But remember, if I don't win,

519
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:51,039
you're fired.

520
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:54,873
Oh, I'm just joking with you.  There's no way you're gonna beat me.

521
00:34:55,123 --> 00:34:57,333
I'm gonna wipe the floor with you. [door closes]

522
00:34:57,666 --> 00:35:00,582
We have a lot in common with monks and prison inmates.

523
00:35:01,291 --> 00:35:02,915
In research, you work mainly in isolation.

524
00:35:03,165 --> 00:35:05,582
It should be the sole focus of your life.

525
00:35:05,873 --> 00:35:09,291
You need to eat, sleep, breathe your research.

526
00:35:10,414 --> 00:35:11,540
I'm allowed to sleep?

527
00:35:11,831 --> 00:35:14,750
Only the lie-awake-in-the-middle-of-the-night kind of sleep.

528
00:35:16,582 --> 00:35:20,000
I need your results on my desk by Monday.

529
00:35:22,249 --> 00:35:25,957
Well, uh, actually sir, I've been having some--, some problems--

530
00:35:28,789 --> 00:35:31,123
Let me give you some advice.

531
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:34,750
In academia, we never use the word 'problems.'

532
00:35:35,249 --> 00:35:37,123
It's considered a sign of weakness.

533
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:42,000
Call them...'challenges'--'issues,' if you must, but never 'problems.'

534
00:35:42,873 --> 00:35:44,540
I have issues.

535
00:35:44,873 --> 00:35:46,540
Not my problem.

536
00:35:46,831 --> 00:35:48,582
Are you using my methodology?

537
00:35:48,915 --> 00:35:51,039
"Yes.
-- So are you saying my method is wrong?"

538
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:54,207
"No.
-- No it's not wrong, or no you're not saying it?"

539
00:35:55,081 --> 00:35:55,915
Yes?

540
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:59,165
[sighs] Maybe I was too ambitious in setting the goals for this project.

541
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,582
Or perhaps you just don't have what it takes

542
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:06,333
to carry out the grandeur of my vision.

543
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,414
Guess which one I think it is?

544
00:36:09,915 --> 00:36:12,789
The fact that you can't make it work doesn't tell me it's impossible.

545
00:36:13,624 --> 00:36:16,123
It only tells me it's impossible for you.

546
00:36:16,333 --> 00:36:18,000
Isn't that the same?

547
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:21,081
That's impossible to say.  Make it work,

548
00:36:21,666 --> 00:36:23,666
or there's no place for you in my research group.

549
00:36:24,165 --> 00:36:25,414
Yes.

550
00:36:25,789 --> 00:36:27,915
Okay, are you ready to play?

00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,708
Uh, what's my name?

Uhhh....

Here are the papers for you to grade.

Don't worry.  It will not be due until the seventeenth.

That's next Monday.

Really?  Oh, then do it by Friday.

568

Today is Friday.

Hi, Mom.  Sorry, I can't talk right now.

573
00:37:45,915 --> 00:37:48,750
I have to grade these papers before dance practice tonight.

574
00:37:49,666 --> 00:37:52,375
Yeah, it's the last one before the competition.

575
00:37:53,123 --> 00:37:55,081
No, I don't think it should take too long.

576
00:37:55,456 --> 00:37:58,414
I mean, we went over this stuff, like, a million times in class, right?

577
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:01,624
They should all get a perfect score!

578
00:38:01,831 --> 00:38:03,333
Wrong.

Wrong, wrong, wrong.

580
00:38:06,249 --> 00:38:11,165
The problem is that to the university, we're in this weird limbo state.

581
00:38:11,624 --> 00:38:13,624
Are we students?  Employees? Neither?

582
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:17,789
Do I give them seven points? Seven and a half points? Seven point seven five?

Indentured servants?

I want to make sure their grade accurately reflects their progress.

Good job.

586
00:38:27,873 --> 00:38:31,414
Anyways, I gotta go.  Professor Rivera wants to talk about my thesis topic.

I thought you didn't have one.

00:39:20,789 --> 00:39:22,789
Can you make the grades have a Gaussian distribution

597
00:39:23,165 --> 00:39:28,498
with a mean of 81.709 and standard deviation 12?

598
00:39:28,957 --> 00:39:31,081
So it will be easier to assign letter grades.

Um, ok.

00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:38,039
By the way, I talked to the Berkeley hiring committee.

You are on the top of their candidates.  I put in a lot of good word for you.

00:40:17,831 --> 00:40:19,750
Could you grade them too?

609
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:22,708
Come on, can't we just bury them?

Both.

I'm working hard, but this is hardly working.

It's the new machine.  Costs more than all of my student loans combined

I've eaten nothing but ramen and caffeine.

Ever heard of a balanced diet?

655
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:26,000
Yes.  Half of those are beef, and the others are shrimp.

And my favorite flavor:  MSG.

I have to finish this.

659

Professor Smith says it's "trivial" but I'm starting to think it's impossible.

660
00:43:41,333 --> 00:43:42,666
It's like trying to prove a negative.

661
00:43:42,957 --> 00:43:46,081
You can't show him that it's impossible unless you spend

662
00:43:46,456 --> 00:43:48,333
an infinite amount of time trying to do it.

663
00:43:48,582 --> 00:43:51,957
There is no limit to how long you can spend in grad school.

How has nobody else ever done this before?

665
00:43:55,873 --> 00:43:57,873
I mean I can think of three possibilities.

666
00:43:58,414 --> 00:44:00,414
A:  It's impossible.

667
00:44:00,957 --> 00:44:03,915
B:  Nobody's bothered to do it because it's useless.

C:  Somebody has tried it before--I just don't know about it.

I don't even know which one's the worst.

695

Hash tables are data structures with keys and buckets.

but I don't have time to be in a relationship.

708
00:47:18,165 --> 00:47:19,540
And I dropped out of the dance competition.

That I failed him, and I'm just not good enough.

And then the project that I spent my first seven years on

got retracted. Nobody could reproduce our results.

00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:09,915
but maybe you've just forgotten how to be passionate about anything.

802
00:52:10,249 --> 00:52:12,831
Graduate school is as much about truth in research

803
00:52:13,081 --> 00:52:15,081
as it is about finding truth in yourself.

804
00:52:16,081 --> 00:52:19,207
How do you do it, Tajel? How come you're never stressed?

805
00:52:20,789 --> 00:52:21,624
Well--

806
00:52:21,957 --> 00:52:24,456
How do you do it, Mike? How come you're never stressed?

807
00:52:24,789 --> 00:52:26,789
It's easy in research to get tunnel vision.

808
00:52:27,081 --> 00:52:29,873
You feel isolated, like you're the only person with your problem.

809
00:52:30,291 --> 00:52:31,414
But the truth is

810
00:52:31,708 --> 00:52:34,624
you're not alone.  But whenever I get stressed

811
00:52:34,873 --> 00:52:35,957
I just ask myself the question:

812
00:52:36,333 --> 00:52:37,540
Do I really care?

813
00:52:37,873 --> 00:52:40,582
Would I rather be doing anything else?

814
00:52:40,915 --> 00:52:44,039
You're not a machine. You have to embrace the things you're passionate about.

815
00:52:44,666 --> 00:52:47,789
Every great idea, every great moment of "Eureka!",

816
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:50,333
came when it was least expected.

817
00:52:50,789 --> 00:52:51,333
Google,

818
00:52:51,582 --> 00:52:54,666
Facebook, Newton and gravity, Einstein and relativity--

819
00:52:55,498 --> 00:52:58,666
all of these things happened when they weren't doing what they were supposed to be doing.

820
00:52:59,123 --> 00:53:01,333
When they were following their passion--

821
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:03,750
Procrastinating.

822
00:53:05,414 --> 00:53:07,957
I need to relax.

823
00:53:08,207 --> 00:53:09,666
Exactly.

824
00:53:09,957 --> 00:53:13,375
No! I mean my experiment.

825
00:53:14,249 --> 00:53:17,039
That's why I haven't been able to get the data.

826
00:53:17,333 --> 00:53:20,333
I need to relax to boundary limit conditions--of course!

827

[music]

828
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,291
I could still make the competition!

829

Yes!

830
00:53:38,957 --> 00:53:41,831
How do I look?

831
00:53:46,081 --> 00:53:48,708
Ready to rumba.

832
00:53:48,957 --> 00:53:51,831
Uh, Miss T.A.?

833
00:53:54,957 --> 00:53:56,375
What about the homework?

834
00:53:56,831 --> 00:53:58,915
It's all in the book!

835
00:53:59,249 --> 00:54:00,456
I've figured it out.

836
00:54:00,789 --> 00:54:03,249
Professor Smith's methodology, it's not right or wrong.

837
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,789
It's just that it doesn't apply for all of the experimental conditions.

838
00:54:07,708 --> 00:54:09,000
Whoa.

839
00:54:09,249 --> 00:54:10,666
Does anyone have a--

840
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,456
Here. Use mine.

841
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,582
Thanks!

842
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,750
Does anyone know the fastest way to the symposium?

843
00:54:16,957 --> 00:54:19,207
Yeah, take the sub-sub-basement corridor to the Millikan Library.

844
00:54:19,498 --> 00:54:21,498
Topside is swarming with the tour groups at this time.

845
00:54:21,789 --> 00:54:23,789
"Thanks!
-- Wait!"

846
00:54:24,207 --> 00:54:26,915
You'll need this!

847
00:54:27,207 --> 00:54:29,207
Thanks!

Uh, yeah, yeah.  I will be.

All right, I gotta go.

I thought you couldn't make it to the competition.

00:55:26,456 --> 00:55:29,540
I decided to give myself extra credit.

[music]

861
00:56:17,081 --> 00:56:18,249
So.

00:56:18,456 --> 00:56:20,039
So?

863
00:56:20,375 --> 00:56:23,165
That project I assigned you wasn't impossible after all.

864
00:56:23,414 --> 00:56:24,831
I guess not.

865
00:56:25,165 --> 00:56:26,414
Huh.

866
00:56:26,708 --> 00:56:28,123
Are you surprised by my competence?

867
00:56:28,333 --> 00:56:30,624
I must be losing my touch.

868
00:56:31,123 --> 00:56:34,207
Although, showing up with the data you did at the last minute,

869
00:56:34,456 --> 00:56:37,375
that was, uh, that was dramatic.

870
00:56:38,249 --> 00:56:41,291
A little bit of theatrics can go a long way in academia.

871
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:44,708
Sometimes I ask my students not to give me their data

872
00:56:45,291 --> 00:56:47,081
until the night before a presentation.

873
00:56:47,291 --> 00:56:51,207
That way I can honestly say it's data that my grad student just sent me.

874
00:56:52,333 --> 00:56:55,000
Well I thought you'd want to see this right away.

875
00:56:55,291 --> 00:56:59,249
It was...interesting.  Might make a good Figure 1 on a Ph. D. thesis.

876
00:56:59,957 --> 00:57:01,708
Just Figure 1?

877
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
1a.

878
00:57:05,375 --> 00:57:09,333
Unfortunately, I don't have any funding for another Ph. D. student right now.

879
00:57:10,081 --> 00:57:15,498
However, I do have some interesting ideas for a new proposal.

880
00:57:18,081 --> 00:57:20,789
If you'd help me write it, and if it gets funded,

881
00:57:21,456 --> 00:57:24,000
I might consider taking you on.

882
00:57:24,789 --> 00:57:27,915
Yes.  I'd like that, Professor.

883
00:57:29,624 --> 00:57:32,207
No need to thank me, uh...

884
00:57:32,375 --> 00:57:35,123
Winston.  My name is Winston.

885
00:57:35,789 --> 00:57:37,414
Very well.

886
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:39,957
Now get back to the lab.

[music]

888
00:57:49,789 --> 00:57:51,789
You came to recitation.

889
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:55,123
You stopped making lecture handouts.

890
00:57:55,957 --> 00:57:59,291
So now, we have to come and, like, pay attention and stuff.

891
00:58:08,081 --> 00:58:11,831
Who's ready to learn about hash tables?!

892
00:58:15,207 --> 00:58:17,207
Get it?  Keys?

893
00:58:21,123 --> 00:58:23,291
Yes? Do you need an extension?

894
00:58:23,498 --> 00:58:25,708
No, actually I wanted to say thanks.

895
00:58:25,915 --> 00:58:28,207
This has been a really cool class.

896
00:58:28,456 --> 00:58:30,915
I can't wait to get to more complicated stuff next term.

897
00:58:31,081 --> 00:58:33,708
Really? You think this stuff is cool?

898
00:58:33,957 --> 00:58:36,165
Yeah, but I'm kind of a dork.

899
00:58:36,456 --> 00:58:39,249
You're like a grad student waiting to happen.

900
00:58:39,708 --> 00:58:42,789
I hope not, but thanks again.  I'll see you around.

00:58:43,708 --> 00:58:45,333
Uh, you too.

You have nine months to deliver your thesis.

Hi.

Hi.

909
00:59:27,333 --> 00:59:29,249
Can I help you with that?

910
00:59:29,498 --> 00:59:32,165
Oh, uh, yeah.  Thanks.

911
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:44,207
Hi.  Are you guys graduate students?

912
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:47,624
This is for my thesis.  I'm studying why

913
00:59:47,915 --> 00:59:51,333
there's a fifty percent dropout rate amongst Ph. D. students.

914
00:59:51,708 --> 00:59:54,081
That means that two out of every four graduate students

915
00:59:54,291 --> 00:59:56,915
will never graduate.

916
00:59:57,249 --> 01:00:01,039
But I know that there're a lot of issues that I should be really concerned about,

917
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:05,165
especially as a graduate student, because, you know, no one's really going to be your advocate.

918
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,540
So.

919
01:00:12,789 --> 01:00:15,165
How's research?
