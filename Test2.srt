1
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,180
<i>The war between sorcerers</i>

2
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,740
<i>was fought in the shadows of history</i>

3
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:03,220
<i>and the fate of mankind rested with
the just and powerful Merlin.</i>

4
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,380
<i>He taught his secrets
to three trusted apprentices,</i>

5
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:12,830
<i>Balthazar, Veronica, and Horvath.</i>

6
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,670
<i>He should have trusted only two.</i>

7
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,910
<i>Veronica and Balthazar
witnessed the savagery</i>

8
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,970
<i>of a sorcerer beyond evil,</i>

9
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:37,450
<i>Morgana le Fay,
Merlin's most deadly enemy.</i>

10
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,640
We are but servants.

11
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,270
- Merlin.
- Horvath!

12
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,310
You betray me?

13
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,080
I am no one's servant.

14
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,890
Well done. Now get the spell.

15
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,920
<i>And so it was. Morgana
gained sorcery's most dangerous spell</i>

16
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,460
<i>known as "The Rising, "</i>

17
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,660
<i>giving Morgana the power
to raise an army of the dead</i>

18
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,040
<i>and enslave mankind.</i>

19
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,810
<i>Veronica sacrificed herself
for Balthazar</i>

20
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,160
<i>by drawing Morgana's soul
into her own body.</i>

21
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,660
<i>But Morgana began to kill her
from the inside.</i>

22
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:56,390
<i>To save Veronica's life
and to capture Morgana,</i>

23
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,870
<i>Balthazar trapped them both
in the Grimhold,</i>

24
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,040
<i>an inescapable prison.</i>

25
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,200
<i>Over time,
Balthazar fought many sorcerers</i>

26
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,880
<i>who tried to free Morgana,</i>

27
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,010
<i>trapping them in layer upon layer
of the doll.</i>

28
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,250
<i>Eventually, he captured
Horvath as well.</i>

29
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,090
<i>As Merlin lay dying,
he gave Balthazar his dragon ring,</i>

30
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,660
<i>saying it would guide him to the child</i>

31
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,760
<i>who would one day grow
to be Merlin's successor,</i>

32
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,660
<i>the Prime Merlinean.</i>

33
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,270
The Prime Merlinean is the only one

34
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,580
who can kill Morgana.

35
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,870
<i>Balthazar would search for centuries.</i>

36
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,460
<i>And never, it is said,
will Balthazar waver from his quest,</i>

37
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,430
<i>for mankind will never be safe</i>

38
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:06,730
<i>until Morgana is destroyed
by the Prime Merlinean.</i>

39
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,150
Hey, Tank.
How did you even get up here?

40
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,880
David? Field trip today.

41
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,190
Don't forget to wear clean underwear.

42
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,250
She means me, not you.

43
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,150
You're not supposed to be
doing that, Dave.

44
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,280
Now!

45
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,050
David.

46
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,000
That's cool.

47
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:22,380
...which means that before Ellis Island
and the Statue of Liberty were built...

48
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,470
Pass it to Becky.

49
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,480
Pass it on.
Pass it on.

50
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,560
- Pass it to Becky.
- Here.

51
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,230
Let's go.

52
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,400
Get on the ferry. Get your bags.
Stay close. Here we go.

53
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,450
Hey, stop!

54
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,170
Excuse me, excuse me.

55
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,910
No!

56
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,770
No, lady, don't!

57
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,840
No way.

58
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,360
The second emperor
of the Han dynasty

59
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,730
locked his least-favorite wife
in this urn for 10 years to the day.

60
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:59,230
They say you open it up,
the same thing will happen to you.

61
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,640
I'm sorry. I'm looking for this note.

62
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,610
Have you seen it?
It kind of just blew into your store.

63
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,510
A note?

64
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,140
It blew into your store.

65
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,150
It was just a...

66
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,910
Coincidence.

67
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,580
Yeah, it was just a coincidence.

68
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,890
I have something
I'd like to show you, Dave.

69
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,790
- How'd you know my name was Dave?
- 'Cause I can read minds!

70
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,940
It's on your backpack.

71
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,500
Come over here.

72
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,920
This is very special

73
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,960
and if it likes you, you can keep it.

74
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,600
I better not. My teacher said
I couldn't be gone for long.

75
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,830
She knows I'm here.

76
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,400
You're a bad liar, Dave.

77
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,400
That's good.

78
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,640
Oh, boy.

79
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,170
No way.

80
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:45,640
I have been searching a very long time.

81
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,240
Magically, here you are.

82
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,550
That ring on your finger
means something, Dave.

83
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,950
It means

84
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,860
you're going to be
a very important sorcerer one day.

85
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:05,570
And your first lesson begins right now
with your very own Encantus.

86
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:09,770
Do not move, do not touch anything.

87
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,500
No way.

88
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,080
When am I?

89
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,090
New York City.

90
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,890
Not where. The year.

91
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,690
You are wasting my time.

92
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:50,970
What happened
to "don't touch anything"?

93
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,160
That's not very sporting of you,
Balthazar.

94
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:54,230
Be quiet.

95
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:58,440
It's not you. He's been like this
for 1,000 years. I'll explain later.

96
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,340
I need the Grimhold. Where's that doll?

97
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,360
I'll have that doll.

98
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,800
I want that doll.

99
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,150
Leave, Dave! Leave now!

100
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,790
David Stutler! Don't ever leave your...

101
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,660
There's these crazy wizard guys
in there!

102
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,890
They're made of roaches!

103
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,740
No! Don't go in there!
The store's on fire! Don't go in!

104
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,570
Those guys are

105
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:09,830
crazy.

106
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,510
You really shouldn't
tell stories. Let's go.

107
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,220
Ew! He peed his pants!

108
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:27,960
A jar broke. It's just water!
There was a fire!

109
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,490
Yeah, Stutler had a leak.

110
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,530
He's such a geek.

111
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,990
Good morning. What is that? Oh, right.

112
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,030
Good morning, beautiful.

113
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,100
Hey, heads up.

114
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,270
Oh.

115
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,510
Happy birthday.

116
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,640
Thank you, Bennet.

117
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,010
You're up early.

118
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:29,020
Professor Heiderman wants me to give
a presentation to his Physics 101 class.

119
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,320
What? Teaching long division
to English majors?

120
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:34,290
I know. It's like the Peace Corps,
but it's Heiderman's class.

121
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:37,700
Hey, Bio nerds
are getting drunk tonight.

122
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,760
And we invited cheerleaders
from Princeton.

123
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,440
Oh. So there's smart cheerleaders.

124
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:50,910
So, seriously, you're saying you don't
want to go out on your birthday?

125
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:56,270
I got to finish my Tesla coil project
if I want to graduate.

126
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:02,280
Dave, are you familiar
with the gray wolf?

127
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,520
Oh, no, please, Bennet. Not this again
with the gray wolf. I can't...

128
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,990
The gray wolf is a pack animal.

129
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,830
He must find a mate.
He must hunt and grunt.

130
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,630
He must participate.

131
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:17,000
You're going to get
booted out of the pack!

132
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,400
Alone. Eaten by a hungry bear.

133
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:26,210
That's a real pick-me-up pep talk,
and I'm ready to go get the day.

134
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,790
No, no.

135
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,720
Oh, man.

136
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,630
Everything okay down there?

137
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,170
I should just leave, right?

138
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,700
Right.

139
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,220
Wait. I'm sorry. Becky?

140
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,140
Becky Barnes.

141
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,750
Dave!

142
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,360
We were in fourth grade together.

143
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,130
I do know you. Dave Stutler.

144
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,860
- Right?
- That's me.

145
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,430
Yeah. You're that kid.

146
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,040
What was that place called?

147
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:27,230
- Arcana...
- Arcana Cabana?

148
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:28,700
Yeah.

149
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,680
- So, did you transfer?
- Yeah, I did.

150
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,510
And got some help. Treatment.

151
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,410
Yes, that was weird.

152
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:43,420
You know what? It turns out
it's just a glucose imbalance.

153
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,020
Hallucinations?

154
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,990
- Not uncommon in young subjects.
- Ah...

155
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,690
Right.

156
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:52,260
It's a great anecdote.

157
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,620
Hey, Becky.

158
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,980
Becky? Hey, Becky?

159
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,790
So how are you enjoying Physics 101?

160
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:23,020
My brain
just does not think physics.

161
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,130
So, what does it think, then?

162
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,960
Music, mostly.

163
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,670
So, this is me.

164
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,600
You work at the radio station?

165
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,640
Yeah, I do an afternoon show.

166
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,540
Are you kidding me? That's so cool!

167
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,600
It's just college radio.
Like, seven people listen to it.

168
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,740
I'll be listening. That's one more.
You can round it up to eight.

169
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,920
I think that's our antenna!

170
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,920
- What's going on?
Hey, gorgeous.

171
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,620
The whole mixer is toast,
and Freddy called in sick.

172
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,460
Sorry to bother you.

173
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,130
Where does your engineer
keep his equipment?

174
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,030
Who's this guy?

175
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:08,000
So, the good news is
you're still transmitting.

176
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,570
The bad news is
your return loss, way too high.

177
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,110
All right, if I know what I'm doing,

178
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:22,650
we should be good!

179
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,520
Yes!

180
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:30,560
- Thank you.
- No, please, it was my pleasure.

181
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:34,000
I could tell
this is all pretty important for you.

182
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:39,370
My show is the one thing that...
Well, you know.

183
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,630
Mmm-hmm.

184
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,700
Physics. That's my thing.

185
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,290
I'll see you around.

186
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,220
You didn't ask her out!

187
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:02,160
You just fixed her antenna and you left.

188
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,560
That's not the point.
She will remember me.

189
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,960
"She will remember me"?
Who are you? Braveheart?

190
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:13,400
Bennet, I blew my shot
at getting this girl 10 years ago.

191
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,070
I can't do it again.

192
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:18,070
Now get out of here
before you get electrocuted.

193
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,840
<i>...and it's
a miracle we made it on the air tonight.</i>

194
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:24,750
<i>This show may not matter,
but the music does.</i>

195
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:29,280
<i>This is Becky Barnes, WN YU Radio,
hoping there's music all around you.</i>

196
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,720
I don't understand. Why did you have
to buy this piece of junk?

197
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,200
Junk? It's an antique!

198
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,490
Antique? It's a piece of junk
from a flea market!

199
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,220
Am I the first one out?

200
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,320
That's a yes.

201
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,080
Our 10 years are up, Balthazar.

202
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,460
When I get the Grimhold
from young David,

203
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,360
I'll tell him you said hello.

204
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,560
Cheerio, Balthazar!

205
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,560
I thought B- was generous.

206
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,760
I've recently been released
from a 10-year sentence,

207
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,660
during which the only reading material
available to me

208
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,530
was your so-called report
on Napoleon Bonaparte

209
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,230
from your school bag.

210
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,530
Your analysis was obvious,
your prose was weak.

211
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,970
- I was nine.
- Irrelevant.

212
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:07,100
Where's the Grimhold?
That doll you took from the shop.

213
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:10,080
The doll held something very powerful.

214
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,680
Something very important to me.

215
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,820
You had it last.

216
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,250
I want it back.

217
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,790
Listen, I'm...

218
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,090
- I threw it in the street.
- Where's the Grimhold?

219
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,320
It's been a long time.
I don't actually know where it is.

220
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:28,930
I'll cut the truth out of you.

221
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,030
Sweet.

222
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,610
Get him.

223
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,380
Wolves? No, no, no, no.

224
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,820
Oh!

225
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,260
Thank you.

226
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,730
Wolves.

227
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:24,350
Man, oh, man, oh, man, oh, man.

228
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,290
No, no, no.

229
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,660
Oh, no!

230
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,000
Kill him.

231
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,210
No!

232
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,270
Puppies?

233
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,810
Oh, my.

234
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,550
No way.

235
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,050
Where's the doll, Dave?

236
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,460
Him, him.

237
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,860
All right, get up here.
Now! Now! Hurry!

238
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,900
Oh, no!

239
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:44,770
This is not happening.
This is not happening.

240
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,360
I taste sour in my mouth.

241
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,730
Take it easy, Dave. Deep breaths.

242
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,700
What?

243
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,550
Now that is not happening!

244
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,610
What's wrong?
What is it?

245
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,050
No, no, no, no!

246
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:05,180
You are not doing this to me again!

247
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:09,760
Do you have any idea what my life
has been like for the last 10 years?

248
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,890
I've been stuck in an urn
for the last 10 years.

249
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:17,170
So have I! A figurative urn of ridicule.

250
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,160
Do you know that in certain parts
of the tri-state area,

251
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:24,040
they still refer
to having a nervous breakdown

252
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,340
as "pulling a David Stutler"?
Did you know that?

253
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,850
Try to be a good listener, Dave.

254
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,380
That doll is called the Grimhold.

255
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:36,180
It is a prison for the most dangerous
Morganians in history,

256
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,690
each one locked up
in a layer of the doll.

257
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:45,350
Horvath wants to free his fellow
Morganians and destroy the world.

258
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:50,970
This must not happen.

259
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,870
Yeah. For sure.

260
00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:01,140
The truth is,
you have a very special gift.

261
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,870
You need to see that.

262
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,690
I just want to be normal.

263
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:11,350
Normal life. I want to forget about
that day at Arcana Cabana.

264
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:16,390
I want to forget about magic.
I want to forget everything.

265
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,460
- You should duck.
- What?

266
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,630
You want to forget magic?

267
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,470
Then why did you keep the ring?

268
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:35,540
I was going to sell that on eBay.

269
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,410
You're still a bad liar, Dave.
I like that about you. It's a good sign.

270
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,490
You have the gift.

271
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,750
No, I have a life.

272
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:46,320
You're the last person Horvath saw
with the Grimhold.

273
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,950
That puts you on his list.

274
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:51,400
So unless you want him to turn you
into a pig who just loves physics,

275
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,290
then you better help me
find that doll before he does.

276
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:58,430
This is crazy.
You see how crazy this is, right?

277
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,410
All right. All right.

278
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:05,470
You help me get it back, you're done.

279
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,600
- Really?
- You can walk away.

280
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,650
Can you please put my dresser back?

281
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,220
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

282
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,560
What are you... Oh, no.

283
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,220
Please don't do that.
What are you doing?

284
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:29,690
What?

285
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,700
- Whoa. What is that?
- It's my Grimhold tracking device.

286
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:36,940
Biometric pressure spell displaces
the atmosphere above the doll.

287
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,540
Looks like downtown.

288
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,140
If we can track the Grimhold,
so can Horvath.

289
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:45,550
- So why don't we just take the eagle?
- Too high-profile for a trip downtown.

290
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,780
- I'll have to call you a tow.
- Won't be necessary.

291
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,020
Yeah, but this car's been impounded
for 10 years.

292
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,760
This is low-profile.

293
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:00,860
She missed me.

294
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,200
I'm going to give you the basics.
Strictly Sorcery 101. Put on the ring.

295
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,340
Nothing's going to happen.

296
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:13,540
Yeah?

297
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,790
Kidding. You've heard how people use
only 10В°% of their brains?

298
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:24,990
Sorcerers can manipulate matter
because they're born with the capability

299
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,080
to use the entire power of their brains.

300
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:30,720
Which also explains why molecular
physics comes so easily to you.

301
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,630
So, wait. Is sorcery science or magic?

302
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,130
Yes and yes.

303
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,570
For now, all you need
is a basic combat spell.

304
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:38,690
Making fire.

305
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,160
What causes molecules to heat up?

306
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,270
They vibrate.

307
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,710
Everything we see
is in a constant state of vibration,

308
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,610
thus the illusion of solidity.

309
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,440
But how do we take
that which appears solid

310
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,280
and have it burst into flames?

311
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,750
We will the vibrations to go faster.
Step one, clear your mind.

312
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:57,380
Step two, see the molecules.

313
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,760
Step three, make them shake.

314
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:03,860
- Got it?
- No! I definitely don't "got it. "

315
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,420
Trust the ring, Dave.
And keep it subtle.

316
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,990
Civilians mustn't know magic exists.
That would be complicated.

317
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,970
Says the guy in the 350-year-old
rawhide trench coat.

318
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,740
<i>I threw it in the street.</i>

319
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:28,050
<i>It's been a long time.
I don't actually know where it is.</i>

320
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:30,110
<i>I threw it in the street.</i>

321
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:32,150
<i>Don't go in there!</i>

322
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:34,220
<i>Ew! He peed his pants!</i>

323
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,390
<i>The store's on fire! Don't go in!
Those guys are...</i>

324
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:39,660
<i>It's just water! There was a fire!</i>

325
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,330
<i>I threw it in the street.</i>

326
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,800
But where?

327
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,110
Get out of the way, freak!
I need to pull in there!

328
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,610
Are you addressing me?

329
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,220
Hey, don't mess with me.

330
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,620
Where was I?

331
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:09,460
Chinatown.

332
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:31,980
This is it. I'll get the Grimhold.
Keep an eye out for Horvath.

333
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:42,050
Hi.

334
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:11,310
Can I help you?
Do you have an appointment?

335
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,720
I'm sorry to trouble you.
I'm looking for a...

336
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:17,830
Well, it's rather strange.
It's a nesting doll. It's about this big.

337
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:20,190
Angry-looking Chinese gentleman
on the front.

338
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,320
- Nesting doll?
- Yes.

339
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:25,200
It's possible. I collect so many objects.

340
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:30,240
Ah!

341
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:32,680
You speak Mandarin.

342
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,010
Ah.

343
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,610
That was Cantonese, Horvath.

344
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,210
The Grimhold. Where is it?

345
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,710
An old associate of mine
speaks impeccable Cantonese.

346
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,850
He lived about 200 years ago.

347
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:50,920
Know him? Sun Lok.

348
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:55,860
Of course you do.
You locked him inside the Grimhold.

349
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,960
Whoops.

350
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,700
Opened it.

351
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,080
Whoa!

352
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,210
Are you all right?

353
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,040
Looks like...

354
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:13,710
What the...

355
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,850
Yay!

356
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,450
I'm like one of them.

357
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:18,580
Dave?

358
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:20,680
You should run.

359
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,850
Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry.

360
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:22,110
Be still.

361
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,630
Balthazar!

362
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,210
Oh, God. Come on.

363
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,310
You skipped the first step!

364
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,410
- Clear your mind!
- Skipped the first step.

365
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,430
Clear my mind? Are you insane?

366
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:08,420
Little bit.

367
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,100
Oh, man.

368
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:32,290
This is it.

369
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,090
Clear your mind. Believe.

370
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,840
Yeah!

371
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,120
Go Team Magical Stuff!

372
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:17,130
Did you see that?
Did you see what I just did?

373
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,190
I did it.

374
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,540
It can't be.

375
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,010
Unbelievable.

376
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,920
Hey, what do you got?
Did you see what happened here?

377
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:42,890
You know what? Bottle rocket meets
paper dragon in this Asian festival.

378
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,720
Lit it up like a birthday cake.

379
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,920
We got swamped with calls
saying there was a real dragon.

380
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,360
Between you and me, Cap,
I think some of these folks

381
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,840
were hitting the sake pretty hard.

382
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:55,130
Sake's Japanese, actually.

383
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:00,840
Carry on.

384
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,710
- "Sake's Japanese"?
- Well, it is.

385
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:08,220
- I was in character.
- Oh, right.

386
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:15,580
You may now return the ring to me.

387
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:21,000
I'm a man of my word.
You helped me, we're done.

388
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:22,860
Right. Right.

389
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,040
I'd like to learn some more.

390
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,140
We'll need a place to work.

391
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,380
Somewhere under Horvath's radar.

392
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,140
I think I can help with that.

393
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:51,460
This was originally
a subway turnaround.

394
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,120
They let me work down here

395
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:56,600
because some of my experiments
skew a bit dangerous.

396
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,770
Oh, my professor has a hookup,
so nobody knows we're down here.

397
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,410
Oh.

398
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,110
I didn't have a chance
to give you this before.

399
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,410
Your Encantus.

400
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:14,480
I remember it being bigger.

401
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:16,150
Pocket edition.

402
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:18,820
The Encantus is our textbook.

403
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:24,450
The art and science and history
of sorcery.

404
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:27,390
Including our recent history as well.

405
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,730
Come on.

406
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,330
See? There you are.

407
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,070
Oh.

408
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:41,740
Before we can put Horvath
back inside the Grimhold,

409
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:44,510
we must first turn you into a sorcerer,

410
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,880
which begins now.

411
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,620
Step back.

412
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,450
- I really was doing stuff.
- Eyes open.

413
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:53,980
Mouth closed.

414
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:29,730
This is the Merlin Circle.

415
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:32,050
It focuses your energy.

416
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:35,120
Helps you master new spells.

417
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:38,360
It is where you will learn the Art.

418
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:42,810
Step inside,
you leave everything else behind.

419
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,800
Once you enter,

420
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,610
there is no going back.

421
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,950
So, I should probably pee first?

422
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,180
Better safe than...

423
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:02,020
I can hold it.

424
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,460
I am Balthazar Blake,

425
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,970
sorcerer of the 777th degree,

426
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:16,760
and you are my apprentice.

427
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,110
Sweet.

428
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:23,610
Your ring is not a piece of jewelry.

429
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:27,410
It projects the electrical energy
of your nervous system

430
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:29,150
into the physical world.

431
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:32,490
Without his ring,
a sorcerer is powerless.

432
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,490
The only other thing a sorcerer needs

433
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,690
is a nice pair of pointy shoes.

434
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,960
Your rubber soles block the current.

435
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,930
Plus it helps to look classy.

436
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,090
These are old man shoes.

437
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:50,400
Excuse me?

438
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,540
I love them.

439
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,470
A lot.

440
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:17,300
I haven't seen that cane since I saw
a picture of it when I was a boy.

441
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,160
You've been locked up a long time.

442
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,500
And now I'm out.

443
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,740
And I need soldiers.

444
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,030
I got one kid.

445
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:28,350
He ain't old school.

446
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:30,180
One will do.

447
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,510
Your ingenuity and your heart

448
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:36,640
will give you an advantage
over Morganians.

449
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:39,620
They rely only
on the power of their magic.

450
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:44,760
But if you're up against the wall,
there's only one weapon of choice,

451
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:46,560
the plasma bolt.

452
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,830
Nothing. There's nothing.

453
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:00,770
I got it! I got one! I got one!

454
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,450
That's underwhelming.

455
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,210
God.

456
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,780
Again.

457
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,390
Ow! Ow! Ow!

458
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,900
...and invite my soul...

459
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:21,090
And again.

460
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:25,360
See? That's what padding is for. Oh!

461
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:36,450
So, out of a bath full of jewels,
I'm going to emerge, right?

462
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,070
And everyone's going to think I'm me.

463
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,780
I reach into the big top hat
and I pull myself out,

464
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:43,680
but I'm a woman.

465
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:48,390
A ball of fire, right, a baby sitting
in a nappy, but I would like a tiger.

466
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:51,620
If I could get, like,
a tiger jumping out of a leopard.

467
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,590
But not out of its mouth,
that's been done, I'm sure, somewhere.

468
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:59,500
Gorgeous. Just perfect, darling.

469
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:02,630
Yeah. Yeah, now,
keep it straight up sinister.

470
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,670
Oh, do tell me this is a joke.

471
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,080
Sorry, are you lost?

472
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:13,180
So, you're what passes
for a Morganian these days.

473
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:18,190
Maxim Horvath!
You are one smoking man of...

474
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,820
Will you excuse us, ladies?

475
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:21,930
Yes, excuse us, ladies.

476
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,020
Bob.

477
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:26,320
Bob.

478
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,430
Sorry.

479
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:33,400
So, they tell me
you're some kind of entertainer.

480
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:37,640
Five sold-out shows at the Garden,
plus back end on the pay-per-view.

481
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,610
Did you ever see Morgana
pull a rabbit out of a hat?

482
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:46,210
Look, my master disappeared
when I was 15, vanished!

483
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:47,950
Left me with nothing but an Encantus

484
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:50,680
and some prescription-grade
abandonment issues.

485
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,550
So I improvised.

486
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:55,120
Well, the time for improvisation is over.

487
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,560
Balthazar Blake may have found
the Prime Merlinean.

488
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:01,960
He wears the ring?

489
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:03,260
Mmm.

490
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:08,800
The best way to defend against fire,

491
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,370
vacuum sphere.

492
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:15,340
Your turn.

493
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:21,910
I did it! I did it!

494
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:24,380
Excellent. Excellent.

495
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,850
- Excellent.
- I just did that.

496
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:33,060
What's wrong with your Tesla coil?
It seems to be firing on its own.

497
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,270
Really, really funny.

498
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:41,100
This will be hilarious, then.

499
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:42,540
Oh, my God!

500
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:48,840
Dude!

501
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:52,610
Beg your pardon.
I haven't eaten in 10 years.

502
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:54,980
Yeah. Yeah, fair enough.

503
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,520
You mind if I ask
what's so special about this bench?

504
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:04,020
- No, no, no.
- What?

505
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,930
There's no time for that,
and too much at stake.

506
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:07,760
That girl,

507
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:10,600
she's the one, man.

508
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,560
And you're my mentor, Balthazar.

509
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:17,540
Aren't you supposed to help me
to achieve my personal goals?

510
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:20,900
Yes! Yes! Except I'm not your mentor.

511
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,710
I'm your master.

512
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:25,840
And your master says
if Horvath catches you out on the street,

513
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,280
you'll die.

514
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:29,420
Is she worth that?

515
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:31,620
Think about it, Dave.

516
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,690
And don't eat my sandwich.

517
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:43,360
Becky! What a coincidence.

518
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,160
Oh, hey, Dave.

519
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,900
- Going uptown or...
- Are you stalking me?

520
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,460
Not in a threatening way.

521
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,770
Why was I even concerned?

522
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:54,850
So I listened to your show last night.

523
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:57,070
- What did you think?
- It was amazing.

524
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,910
I've never actually heard
of any of those bands,

525
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:01,350
which I think is a good indicator
that they're cool.

526
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:05,120
I'm glad someone was listening.

527
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:08,260
This may come as a surprise to you,
I don't get up to much.

528
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:11,250
Give me the cash. Give it. Come on.

529
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:12,520
- Give me the bracelet.
- Okay, okay.

530
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,090
- Give me.
Hey, hey, hey.

531
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:19,060
That was my grandmother's bracelet.

532
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:23,800
No! Dave, don't!

533
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:37,520
You just give me
that bracelet back, please.

534
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,520
You better run back to your girlfriend.

535
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:42,790
Believe me, I wish she was...

536
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:44,560
You thought she was my girlfriend?

537
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:47,860
Really? Is that the kind of vibe you got?

538
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:50,090
You talk too much. Shut up.

539
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:54,800
What are you doing?

540
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:57,640
I have no idea what you're referring to.
I honestly...

541
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:01,440
Whoa!

542
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,280
- You seeing this?
- Heads up.

543
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:09,610
Up the stairs!

544
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:12,750
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Here you go.

545
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,820
Your grandmother's bracelet.

546
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:18,020
How did you do that?
That guy was huge.

547
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,060
I've been doing a lot
of cardio boxing lately.

548
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:25,800
Let me introduce Thunder, Lightning.

549
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:31,610
Something about you seems different.

550
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,580
I'm wearing new shoes.

551
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:39,350
- Nice.
- Thank you. This your train?

552
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:42,610
Yes. Thank you.

553
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,050
I just want to tell you that

554
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:47,380
if you want me to help you
with your midterms,

555
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:48,680
come by my lab.

556
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:51,420
- I'll text you the address.
- Yes, yes, that would be great.

557
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,330
- Yeah?
- Tomorrow?

558
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,560
It's a date.

559
00:47:56,130 --> 00:48:00,160
No, no, no. It's not a date!
It's a date like an appointment.

560
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:03,400
No. A date like an appointment!

561
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,740
Love is a distraction.

562
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:18,190
Sorcery requires complete focus.

563
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:22,250
Let's go, Thunder and Lightning.
There's more to learn.

564
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:28,660
This is perfect.

565
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,400
The Rising will happen here.

566
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,270
We'll use their satellite dishes
on the rooftops.

567
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:40,380
There, and there, and there.

568
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:45,470
- Get it done.
- My "Best of" DVD drops next month.

569
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:49,280
Here we go. All right. Move.

570
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:55,390
Sorry about that. It's just nice for them
to see a genuine icon like me.

571
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:58,790
Fortunately, they'll all be dead soon.

572
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,360
And before that,
we need to find the boy.

573
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:03,830
Well, how do we do that?

574
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,570
We'll wait until he's alone.

575
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:15,950
Now, focus on control.
Set me down slow and steady.

576
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:22,240
Dave? It's Becky.

577
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:25,410
I'll be back shortly.

578
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,150
Could you please hide?
Hide now. Please.

579
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:29,990
Dave, get back here.

580
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:31,460
We have important work to do.

581
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,830
Knock, knock.
- Yeah.

582
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,130
- Hi.
- Hi.

583
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:38,530
We should go. A library, anyplace...

584
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:39,700
Dave?

585
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:43,070
Is that company I hear?

586
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:48,240
Yeah. Okay. Fine. Becky, this is my...

587
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:50,650
Uncle. Uncle Balthazar.

588
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,540
Hey, Dave, I'm confused.

589
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:54,880
I thought you and I
were staying in together.

590
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:56,550
If this is a bad time,

591
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,280
- I can come back.
- Yes, actually.

592
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,420
No. No.

593
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:02,960
Uncle, you and I have plans for later on.

594
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:05,120
Becky, let's just get out of here.

595
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,600
You know what? It's all right,
because I just remembered

596
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:10,730
I have to go into town
to pick up your anti-itch cream.

597
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:13,740
So, you two stay here.
Pleasure to meet you.

598
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:07,750
Okay, enough with the studying.
There's something I want to show you.

599
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:10,350
- What are these things?
- Tesla coils.

600
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:14,430
I was using them
to generate something called plasma.

601
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:20,090
The thing is, I got so fixated
on the technical aspects of it

602
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:24,740
that I almost didn't notice
something kind of

603
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:26,530
beautiful.

604
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:31,140
I think you'd better step into my cage.

605
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:35,450
Okay, it's definitely the first time
anyone has said that to me.

606
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:37,580
I'm not surprised.

607
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,160
Just hold on to this bar, please.

608
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:43,590
Both hands. Yep.

609
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,320
Okay.

610
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:55,400
Okay, hold on tight and enjoy the show.

611
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:03,340
Oh, my gosh.

612
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:06,520
How is this possible?

613
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:09,920
The coils are firing
at such a high frequency

614
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:14,020
that the sparks literally create
soundwaves as they fly through the air.

615
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:15,990
Which is nerdy.

616
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,310
You were listening.

617
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:35,540
I played this song the other night.

618
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:38,250
These coils are my life.

619
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:41,750
Two years I'm down here
working with them,

620
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:45,090
and they're making their own music
and it was lost on me.

621
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,850
I was never able to appreciate it

622
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:50,350
until I met you

623
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:54,860
and heard you talking about music
on your radio show, and...

624
00:52:56,430 --> 00:52:58,160
I'm sappy.

625
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:25,850
This is me.

626
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:30,060
So, do you want to meet up later?
8:00? My lab?

627
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,760
Yeah. Yeah, that would be great.

628
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:33,960
With me?

629
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:35,970
With you? Yes.

630
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:37,230
Making sure.

631
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:41,070
- I got to... Yoga.
- Yeah, I've got to go to the bathroom.

632
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:46,970
<i>I got a date with a girl
'cause I'm awesome</i>

633
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:50,110
So, you're the one.

634
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,020
Excuse me?

635
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:56,050
Prime Merlinean, eh?
You don't look like much.

636
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:00,200
I don't actually know
what you're talking about.

637
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:02,130
Cool. Makes this easy.

638
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:09,240
Can't have anyone
hearing your girly cries, right?

639
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:12,640
I don't actually know who you are.

640
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,070
Really, you don't recognize me?

641
00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:17,450
Are you in Depeche Mode?

642
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,070
What... What...

643
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:26,120
- What do you weigh, like a buck 20?
- Whoa! What the...

644
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,690
This is high school all over again.

645
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,460
All right, I tell you what.

646
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:35,490
Hit me with your best shot,
your most powerful spell.

647
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:38,790
- Okay.
- Get the ring out. Put it on. Good boy.

648
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:42,470
Okay.

649
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:44,600
Ow!

650
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,440
- No, I'm joking.
- Nothing is happening.

651
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,380
- Have you cleared your mind?
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

652
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,400
- That's nerves and it's the pressure.
- I got nothing happening.

653
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:52,510
- I'm new at this.
- The ring's on. Take the ring off.

654
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:53,640
- Take off the ring.
- Take it off.

655
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:57,350
- Yeah, it doesn't help me...
- Enough, you idiot. Watch the door.

656
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:03,420
You.

657
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:07,790
No!

658
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:11,900
- Hello, Dave.
- Hi.

659
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,370
- So, Dave.
- Oh, man.

660
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:22,440
I'm going to kill you. Oh, yes,
right here in this dismal bathroom.

661
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,210
It's not very classy, but there you go.

662
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:27,610
But before we get
to that unpleasantness,

663
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:29,640
you're going to tell me
where the Grimhold is.

664
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:32,350
Where is she?

665
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:34,980
She?

666
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,220
He hasn't told you, has he?

667
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:42,690
The truth about who's inside the doll?

668
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:48,900
Sweetheart, you've put your faith
in the wrong man.

669
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,500
Tell me, have you ever been in love?

670
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:57,210
- I...
- Yeah.

671
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:59,650
You're in love right now.
I can see it in your eyes.

672
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,950
No, no, no, no. Don't deny it.

673
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:04,750
I wonder what would happen

674
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,980
if you lost her.

675
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:11,060
Shut up.

676
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:17,030
You'd be no better than the rest of us.

677
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:25,940
Where is the Grimhold?

678
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:29,940
I don't know.

679
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,310
Oh, Dave, you really are
the most dreadful liar.

680
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:35,550
That's what I keep telling him.

681
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:37,050
Want your guy back?

682
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,350
Oh!

683
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,130
It's been a while since I've seen
the Hungarian Mirror Trap.

684
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:53,560
I guess I'm just old-fashioned.

685
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,870
Balthazar, look out!

686
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:09,320
What are you doing here, Dave?

687
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,920
Horvath was trying to kill me.

688
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:14,390
His moral compass
doesn't exactly point north.

689
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:16,550
Yeah, well, what about yours? Huh?

690
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:19,690
You haven't been completely truthful
with me.

691
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,530
That guy called me
the Prime Merlinean.

692
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:24,830
Balthazar, what is that?

693
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,100
Now, I'm not doing anything else

694
00:57:27,370 --> 00:57:31,210
until you start being truthful with me
about what's going on.

695
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,040
Who is in that Grimhold?

696
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:38,180
Morgana.

697
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:46,820
Wake up that moron

698
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:49,590
in stall number three for me,
would you?

699
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:56,330
Oh, for heaven's sake.

700
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,360
Morgana.

701
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:03,710
She was making preparations
for The Rising,

702
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:07,040
something that would enable her
to enslave mankind

703
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,600
by resurrecting
dead Morganian sorcerers.

704
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:12,810
So, after the witch girl,
there's another doll

705
00:58:12,850 --> 00:58:15,250
that contains the greatest evil
the world has ever known?

706
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:16,640
She's in the last doll.

707
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:20,790
And what does it have to do with this

708
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:23,920
Prime Merlinean?

709
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,990
Merlin had three apprentices.

710
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:27,660
I was one of them.

711
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:31,470
You were Merlin's apprentice?

712
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,640
He cast a spell to keep us from aging

713
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:37,530
until we found the sorcerer
who would inherit his power.

714
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,670
And his dragon ring.

715
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:46,470
Some part of you, no matter how small,

716
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:49,680
must share the same blood.

717
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,490
As Merlin?

718
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:54,960
Great men have always been called.

719
00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:57,020
This is your calling.

720
00:58:58,500 --> 00:58:59,590
Merlin said,

721
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:04,530
"The only one who will ever be able
to destroy Morgana once and for all

722
00:59:04,570 --> 00:59:06,200
"is the Prime Merlinean. "

723
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:10,470
So I'm supposed to save the world.

724
00:59:12,110 --> 00:59:15,340
I... I just don't think I'm up for that.

725
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:18,510
Do you think
I've been teaching you magic tricks

726
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:20,180
for some little girl's tea party?

727
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:26,710
When you stepped inside this circle,
I told you there was no going back.

728
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:27,850
You took an oath!

729
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:32,620
I have been searching
1,000 years for you.

730
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:35,990
Fighting Morganians,
protecting the Grimhold.

731
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:37,860
You're going to set me free.

732
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:40,600
You have to become
the Prime Merlinean.

733
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:43,270
And I'm not asking.

734
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:55,010
I have a student who's failing my class.
I need his file.

735
00:59:55,850 --> 00:59:59,380
First I'll need to see
your faculty identification card.

736
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:05,420
You don't need
to see my faculty identification card.

737
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:12,360
I don't need
your faculty identification card.

738
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:16,260
"These are not the droids
you're looking for. "

739
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:26,050
Here it is.
He has an unauthorized lab space.

740
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:33,180
Okay, so, how will I know when I'm it?

741
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,280
The Prime Merlinean?

742
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:40,150
The Prime Merlinean
will become so powerful within

743
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:43,330
he no longer needs his ring
to cast magic.

744
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,270
When you can do that,

745
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,470
you're ready to take on Morgana.

746
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:52,170
Tank! What is he doing here anyway?

747
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:56,340
This should be good.

748
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:00,180
Schematic for a fusion spell.

749
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:04,010
The merging of two souls
into one physical body.

750
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:09,090
I've only ever seen one sorcerer
successfully pull off human fusion.

751
01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:11,860
And Tank is here for...

752
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:13,190
Practice.

753
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:16,370
Are you telling me
you're trying to possess Tank?

754
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:25,070
Yeah. I'm not so sure
it's the best idea, either.

755
01:01:25,610 --> 01:01:26,800
No.

756
01:01:29,910 --> 01:01:31,070
Oh, man.

757
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:37,620
Becky's coming now,
and I'm standing in a puddle of pop.

758
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:38,950
I need to stop and clean.

759
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:40,290
We're not done training.

760
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:46,400
Balthazar, I've been waiting
for 10 years to see this girl again.

761
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:49,120
Do you have any idea what that's like?

762
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:53,400
When I come back,
you better be focused.

763
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,070
Ow.

764
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:03,610
This is really sticky.

765
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:07,780
I'm doomed.

766
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:10,950
This.

767
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:16,520
Thank you. Thank you.

768
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:51,020
I command you to stop!

769
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:58,160
Oh, no. Man.

770
01:04:26,590 --> 01:04:27,650
Becky.

771
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:31,390
- Hi.
- Hi. You're on time.

772
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:36,230
- You forgot?
- No, no, no. I didn't forget.

773
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:38,300
- Is everything okay?
- What, me?

774
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:40,030
How are you doing?

775
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:42,110
I'm good. I'm good.

776
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:45,370
Would you please stop that?
Will you...

777
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:51,510
It's probably best for you to leave.

778
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:53,570
What am I saying?

779
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:55,920
Okay. Okay, I will go.

780
01:04:56,290 --> 01:04:58,850
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm having issues.

781
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,120
My coils!

782
01:05:22,110 --> 01:05:23,240
Disperse!

783
01:05:35,490 --> 01:05:40,760
You have abused the sacred art,
and you have abused the Merlin Circle.

784
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:42,620
Magic isn't a game.

785
01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:44,330
No shortcuts!

786
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,070
Falling in that water
and getting electrocuted,

787
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:48,970
that's how a sorcerer loses his power!

788
01:05:49,010 --> 01:05:53,030
What rule is that?
Fourteen? Twenty-seven?

789
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:54,370
I can't even remember!

790
01:05:54,410 --> 01:05:55,810
What difference does it make

791
01:05:55,850 --> 01:05:58,180
if it's obvious
that I can't even control a few mops?

792
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:00,180
The stronger the man,
the stronger the sorcerer.

793
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:02,480
Thank you.
Thank you for another useless motto!

794
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:03,850
I have another one for you.

795
01:06:03,890 --> 01:06:06,650
You will not control your magic
if you will not control yourself.

796
01:06:06,690 --> 01:06:09,320
You need to stop your worrying
and start believing in yourself.

797
01:06:09,690 --> 01:06:10,820
Is that what you do?

798
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:13,590
- What I do isn't the point.
- I think it is.

799
01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:17,470
I'm convinced you exist purely
to make my life a living hell.

800
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,800
You don't know anything
about a living hell.

801
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:31,500
- You're making progress.
- No, I'm not making progress.

802
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:35,310
No ring, right?

803
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:42,620
No magic.
I can't move the chairs. I can't do it.

804
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,660
It's not me, Balthazar.

805
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:48,690
I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

806
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:55,840
I'm not it. I'm not a hero.
I'm not the Prime Merlinean.

807
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:58,030
I'm just a physics nerd

808
01:06:58,510 --> 01:07:01,970
who looks really, really stupid
in these shoes.

809
01:08:13,150 --> 01:08:14,280
Dave.

810
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:18,180
What are you doing here?

811
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:22,350
I saw you outside the coffee shop,
so I followed you.

812
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:25,430
You looked a little more distressed
than usual.

813
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:27,160
That bad, huh?

814
01:08:27,630 --> 01:08:29,690
Did you really think that
one botched date

815
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:32,000
was going to make me
hate you forever?

816
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:35,230
Yeah.

817
01:08:37,110 --> 01:08:41,070
I do have to ask you this one thing.

818
01:08:43,610 --> 01:08:44,740
What are you doing up here?

819
01:08:45,780 --> 01:08:46,940
Yeah.

820
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:50,380
A friend of mine brought me here once.

821
01:08:50,990 --> 01:08:54,080
And the height doesn't bother you?

822
01:08:55,390 --> 01:08:57,830
- Are you afraid of heights?
- A little bit, yeah.

823
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:59,530
Trust me. Here, come on.

824
01:08:59,730 --> 01:09:01,790
Come on. You're good.

825
01:09:02,070 --> 01:09:04,190
- You're good.
- I don't know.

826
01:09:08,610 --> 01:09:09,730
Wow.

827
01:09:10,410 --> 01:09:12,880
Yeah. Wow.

828
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:18,870
Do you remember when you drew
King Kong on the bus window?

829
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:21,320
And he lined up
with the Empire State Building?

830
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:23,910
You remember that?

831
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:25,950
It was cool.

832
01:09:28,190 --> 01:09:31,420
You saw the world in your own way.

833
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:33,920
I was just trying to impress you.

834
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:39,830
Well, it worked.
Not bad for a 10-year-old kid.

835
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:43,400
Yeah, right. What happened?

836
01:09:44,910 --> 01:09:48,000
- What? What do you mean?
- The bitter irony of the fact

837
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:51,780
that 10-year-old me
is far cooler than 20-year-old me.

838
01:09:52,580 --> 01:09:55,610
I think 20-year-old Dave is...
He's all right.

839
01:09:56,390 --> 01:10:00,880
Like, "all right" all right,
or "all right!" all right?

840
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:07,460
I think he is somewhere in the middle.

841
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:11,030
That's a diplomatic answer.

842
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:13,430
And thank you.

843
01:10:23,150 --> 01:10:24,940
- Hey.
- Hello.

844
01:10:25,150 --> 01:10:26,210
I'm sorry.

845
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:29,050
I think you and I need to have a talk.

846
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:32,590
No apology necessary. Let us move on.

847
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:34,520
You're a diamond, mate.

848
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:51,030
Surprisingly well done.

849
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:52,640
Now go find the Grimhold.

850
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:59,780
You seem to have rather a soft spot
for that boy.

851
01:11:00,180 --> 01:11:02,550
Has Balthazar made a new friend?

852
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:04,820
I don't see the Grimhold.

853
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:07,520
That's because you're using your eyes.

854
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:09,520
Clever Balthazar.

855
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:12,390
Always up to his little tricks.

856
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:35,840
Found it.

857
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:41,120
It's lighter than I remember.

858
01:11:42,790 --> 01:11:44,660
We once fought together, Maxim.

859
01:11:44,730 --> 01:11:46,700
A lot's happened since those days.

860
01:11:46,930 --> 01:11:50,020
- This isn't about that.
- Oh, yes, it is, Balthazar.

861
01:11:50,830 --> 01:11:52,300
It's always been about that.

862
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:57,740
Veronica chose you instead of me,
the great Balthazar Blake,

863
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:01,330
my best friend.

864
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:06,410
Well, I'm going to let you
watch me release Morgana.

865
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:09,880
Let you watch your world
crumble into nothing!

866
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,700
Drake. Let's go.

867
01:12:36,550 --> 01:12:38,810
- Nice catch.
- I owed you one.

868
01:12:39,450 --> 01:12:41,540
- They got the doll.
- Let's get it back.

869
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:46,880
Hang on.

870
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:48,850
Hang on, Tank.

871
01:13:04,270 --> 01:13:05,330
Go left.

872
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:12,820
Whoa! What the...

873
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:15,550
Horvath!
He's in here somewhere.

874
01:13:15,650 --> 01:13:18,310
Wait. He has the power
to turn his car into a taxi?

875
01:13:18,590 --> 01:13:20,520
Use your ring
and lock in on the Grimhold.

876
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:23,550
- Remember, it moves with the ring.
- Okay, yeah. Right, right, right.

877
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:32,730
Go! Go!

878
01:13:35,970 --> 01:13:37,030
Here they come!

879
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:43,840
Whoa!

880
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:44,970
What the heck!

881
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:48,250
Nice one!

882
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:56,030
- Hey! Well, look at that.
- Hang on.

883
01:14:03,930 --> 01:14:04,960
Oh, my God.

884
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:06,560
Take the tunnel.

885
01:14:19,850 --> 01:14:21,720
What is that, smoke?

886
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:29,090
Oh, come on!

887
01:14:41,370 --> 01:14:43,000
Time for a little revenge.

888
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:53,180
- What the heck is this?
- Yes, we drove through a mirror.

889
01:14:53,220 --> 01:14:55,210
- We're trapped in a reverse world.
- So...

890
01:14:55,250 --> 01:14:57,850
It is, it is. Horvath's payback
for the bathroom mirror.

891
01:14:57,890 --> 01:14:59,250
No, no. We won't die as long as

892
01:14:59,290 --> 01:15:00,780
- we get out of here soon.
- Okay.

893
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:03,320
- By driving through our own reflection.
- Fantastic.

894
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:05,360
There. In the window.
- This is it.

895
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:16,760
No, no, no, no, no. You're not...

896
01:15:17,010 --> 01:15:19,030
- Here we go.
- We're not going to make that!

897
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:21,870
We're not...

898
01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:43,460
Hello, Balthazar.

899
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:45,900
Oh, man. Oh, man.

900
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:47,600
No, no, no.
Back up. Back up. Back up. Back up.

901
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:49,610
Back up. Back up. Back up. Back up.

902
01:15:51,710 --> 01:15:52,800
Oh, man.

903
01:15:53,810 --> 01:15:55,470
I've got an idea. I've got an idea.

904
01:15:55,810 --> 01:15:57,540
- Dave, don't.
- Please just let me do it.

905
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:03,150
- What?
- '73 Pinto? This is your idea?

906
01:16:03,190 --> 01:16:06,920
No! No. My idea was to turn their car
into a beater.

907
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:15,960
- Finish it.
- Right!

908
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:27,070
I think he stopped.

909
01:16:38,590 --> 01:16:42,080
Hold on, Tank.
Hold on, Tank. I got you, buddy.

910
01:16:42,190 --> 01:16:43,720
...walked away.

911
01:17:01,510 --> 01:17:02,600
Hey!

912
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:06,840
I'm sorry.
I thought you were someone else.

913
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:12,050
Where's Horvath?

914
01:17:12,290 --> 01:17:13,950
Did he get away?

915
01:17:13,990 --> 01:17:16,620
Where's the Grimhold? Who was that?

916
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:20,530
That was her, wasn't it?

917
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:23,030
The third apprentice.

918
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:30,270
For centuries, Veronica, Horvath and I
were the only thing standing

919
01:17:30,310 --> 01:17:32,940
between Morgana
and man's destruction.

920
01:17:33,810 --> 01:17:37,610
Our friendship and our magic were
what Veronica and I depended on.

921
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:40,840
You fell for her, didn't you?

922
01:17:43,350 --> 01:17:44,910
I fell for her.

923
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:50,850
<i>Like you,
all Veronica wanted was to be normal.</i>

924
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:54,860
<i>Normal things, normal life.</i>

925
01:17:57,030 --> 01:17:58,260
<i>I fell.</i>

926
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,640
And so did Horvath.

927
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:07,200
That's why Horvath betrayed us.

928
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:09,550
For 1,000 years,

929
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:11,910
you've been carrying her
around with you.

930
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:13,910
In the Grimhold.

931
01:18:15,250 --> 01:18:18,120
I was going to give this to her
that night.

932
01:18:26,730 --> 01:18:28,100
I'm sorry.

933
01:18:31,430 --> 01:18:32,800
Okay, Balthazar.

934
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:37,540
We are going to get Veronica out
and destroy Morgana.

935
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:41,080
What's happened to you?

936
01:18:41,510 --> 01:18:42,570
Nothing.

937
01:18:42,850 --> 01:18:44,310
You're still a bad liar.

938
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:48,380
- Why does everyone...
- You know, I am glad she likes you.

939
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:51,510
No, I am not surprised. Only glad.

940
01:18:52,420 --> 01:18:54,890
There's nothing like it, is there?

941
01:18:57,090 --> 01:19:00,890
Put your old man shoes back on.

942
01:19:01,830 --> 01:19:02,960
We have some work to do.

943
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:08,800
Are all the satellite dishes
in position?

944
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:09,960
All lined up.

945
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:13,370
I chipped my mani, which is not cool.

946
01:19:13,410 --> 01:19:15,340
No, I imagine it's not.

947
01:19:16,110 --> 01:19:19,510
Inside there lies our next coworker.

948
01:19:19,850 --> 01:19:23,910
Abigail Williams,
a little witch who put Salem on the map.

949
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:27,180
Once she's out,
we're at the Morgana shell.

950
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:30,920
Now that's going to take a lot of time
and energy to crack.

951
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:32,480
So what are we going to do?

952
01:19:32,530 --> 01:19:34,760
Have you heard of the Parasite Spell?

953
01:19:36,530 --> 01:19:40,260
Sorry, I forgot
your education's somewhat lacking.

954
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:42,770
Yeah, I prefer to go more by instinct.

955
01:19:42,810 --> 01:19:44,710
You know, what feels right.

956
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:49,210
Very good. Well, the Parasite Spell
is a rather nasty piece of business.

957
01:19:49,710 --> 01:19:53,110
It originated in Haiti, if memory serves.

958
01:19:53,650 --> 01:19:57,710
It enables one sorcerer
to steal the energy from another.

959
01:20:03,030 --> 01:20:05,860
Well, you weren't really using it,
were you?

960
01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:18,270
Excuse me?

961
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:19,970
I'd like to make a request.

962
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:23,880
<i>I just finished my show.
But maybe next time, okay?</i>

963
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:35,020
I said I'd like to make a request.

964
01:20:40,030 --> 01:20:41,050
All right.

965
01:20:42,730 --> 01:20:46,360
When Morgana is released,
no matter what happens,

966
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:50,660
promise me you'll do whatever it takes
to destroy her.

967
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:53,400
I promise.

968
01:20:54,980 --> 01:20:57,910
And for the record,
you wear the old guy shoes very well.

969
01:20:59,050 --> 01:21:00,850
My feet disagree with you,
but thank you.

970
01:21:02,690 --> 01:21:03,780
Knuckle bump.

971
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:08,450
Might as well.

972
01:21:09,930 --> 01:21:14,520
Now that I have kidnapped the girl
for you, is it time to release Morgana?

973
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:16,690
I'll give her your regards.

974
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:20,360
Mr. Horvath,
have I done something wrong?

975
01:21:22,170 --> 01:21:23,230
Not at all.

976
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:29,240
I need your power to free Morgana.
I just don't need you.

977
01:21:30,650 --> 01:21:32,310
Well, that's two.

978
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:34,170
One more to go.

979
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:47,260
That's horrifying.

980
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:50,490
Let's just find the Grimhold
and be done with it.

981
01:22:04,050 --> 01:22:06,740
Battery Park. The Rising.

982
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:16,450
Persian Quickrug.

983
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:19,420
And he thinks I'm old-fashioned.

984
01:22:23,070 --> 01:22:24,560
Ostentatious.

985
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:37,910
Ooh... Uh-huh.

986
01:22:45,620 --> 01:22:47,280
Nothing, nothing.

987
01:22:50,260 --> 01:22:51,960
So that's Morgana.

988
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:57,200
Veronica.

989
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:10,740
Balthazar?

990
01:23:11,150 --> 01:23:14,340
That was easy.
Come on, Dave. You know the drill.

991
01:23:14,550 --> 01:23:16,180
Give me what I want, and I'll let her go.

992
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:17,910
Dave, what is going on?

993
01:23:17,950 --> 01:23:19,320
It's gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

994
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:20,380
No, she's not!

995
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:24,520
She's going to be ground up
into chunks and fed to the cat

996
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:27,720
unless you give me Merlin's ring
and the Grimhold.

997
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:30,820
Balthazar?
He's busy admiring the decor.

998
01:23:30,870 --> 01:23:32,660
So what's it going to be?

999
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:03,220
Here.

1000
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:06,190
Take it.

1001
01:24:11,310 --> 01:24:13,300
- You're okay?
- Merlin's ring.

1002
01:24:13,810 --> 01:24:16,800
It's been a while
since I've been this close to it.

1003
01:24:17,550 --> 01:24:19,070
I wonder if it still works.

1004
01:24:25,020 --> 01:24:27,620
- You all right?
- Yeah, I think so.

1005
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:35,260
The Grimhold?

1006
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:40,430
I see.

1007
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:43,730
He took my ring.

1008
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:46,630
He was gonna kill Becky.

1009
01:24:47,610 --> 01:24:49,600
I'm so sorry, Balthazar.

1010
01:24:50,610 --> 01:24:53,050
I would have done
the same thing, Dave.

1011
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:58,280
Where are you going?

1012
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:01,220
Battery Park.
Horvath's going to release Morgana.

1013
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:05,160
Well, you can't take him on
and Morgana at the same time. That's...

1014
01:25:05,190 --> 01:25:07,860
- You literally can't.
- I have to try.

1015
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:09,460
Well, then I'm going with you.

1016
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,490
Without any magic?

1017
01:25:11,870 --> 01:25:13,530
He has your ring.

1018
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:14,800
I'm going alone.

1019
01:25:17,310 --> 01:25:19,770
No, that's a normal thing for him.

1020
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:25,270
No one knows
how much time they have

1021
01:25:26,450 --> 01:25:29,350
to be with the people
that are the most important.

1022
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:31,420
Enjoy it.

1023
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:47,700
That guy just flew away on an eagle!

1024
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:49,260
- I...
- A steel eagle.

1025
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:50,930
Becky, I wanted to talk to you
about this.

1026
01:25:50,970 --> 01:25:53,370
I just haven't known where to start.

1027
01:25:54,540 --> 01:25:56,440
I'm just happy you're okay.

1028
01:25:57,250 --> 01:26:01,910
Look, Dave.
If you can just tell me the truth,

1029
01:26:02,250 --> 01:26:05,850
then I promise I will do my best
to understand.

1030
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:11,690
Okay. The first thing you should know
about me is that I'm a sorcerer.

1031
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:15,720
Okay.

1032
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:20,130
I can conjure and shoot plasma bolts
out of my hand.

1033
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,070
I can speed time up, slow it down,

1034
01:26:23,310 --> 01:26:27,540
varying degrees of levitation.
It's all very magical.

1035
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:33,510
And I thought my last boyfriend
was different 'cause he wore a scarf.

1036
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:43,350
- Baby, I'll just come back. Okay?
- Okay.

1037
01:26:43,390 --> 01:26:46,880
- I'll see you in a minute.
- Okay. All right. I'm here.

1038
01:26:50,770 --> 01:26:51,990
Bad time, Dave.

1039
01:26:52,370 --> 01:26:53,840
Bennet. Thank God you answered.

1040
01:26:53,970 --> 01:26:55,440
<i>I got a real emergency on my hands.</i>

1041
01:26:55,470 --> 01:26:58,300
<i>I need you to meet me
at my lab right now!</i>

1042
01:26:59,780 --> 01:27:03,070
- Becky, I got to let you out.
- What? Let me out?

1043
01:27:03,650 --> 01:27:04,740
Okay.

1044
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:07,870
I think I know how to defeat them
without any magic.

1045
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:09,320
How?

1046
01:27:09,350 --> 01:27:11,250
The rings on Horvath's cane.

1047
01:27:11,290 --> 01:27:14,780
He put them there to gain more power,
but they make him a better conductor.

1048
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:18,230
Dave, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1049
01:27:19,030 --> 01:27:21,360
All right, Rebecca, here it is.

1050
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:25,670
Many evil sorcerers will be
raised from the dead tonight.

1051
01:27:25,900 --> 01:27:30,270
So, basically, Morgana is trying
to destroy the world as we know it.

1052
01:27:31,370 --> 01:27:32,740
Oh, just that.

1053
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:36,580
This is really dangerous.
I can't bring you into it.

1054
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:39,740
Well, I think I'm already into it.

1055
01:27:40,620 --> 01:27:44,350
And besides, if you blow it,
we're all gonna die anyway, right?

1056
01:27:45,190 --> 01:27:46,710
I want to come with you.

1057
01:27:48,820 --> 01:27:49,980
You're sexy.

1058
01:27:52,730 --> 01:27:56,100
- I got all the Tesla coil remotes.
- Thanks, brother. I appreciate it.

1059
01:27:56,470 --> 01:27:58,630
Oh! I found this after we hung up.

1060
01:27:59,670 --> 01:28:01,430
It was on the desk.

1061
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:04,610
"Give this to Veronica. Balthazar. "

1062
01:28:11,410 --> 01:28:14,650
I don't think Balthazar's planning
on coming back.

1063
01:28:16,590 --> 01:28:19,350
I don't know
what you're into here, Dave,

1064
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:24,250
but whatever it is,
you are definitely participating!

1065
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:28,030
Thank you, Bennet. I appreciate that.
We should go.

1066
01:28:41,380 --> 01:28:43,070
Now is The Rising.

1067
01:28:45,450 --> 01:28:46,510
Now is the time.

1068
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:17,140
Veronica.

1069
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:22,540
It's me, Horvath. Morgana.

1070
01:29:23,620 --> 01:29:25,780
No need to look so pathetic.

1071
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,450
Destroy that thing.

1072
01:29:29,490 --> 01:29:31,720
I never want to see it again.

1073
01:29:33,830 --> 01:29:37,420
I cannot raise the dead
until the circle is complete.

1074
01:30:03,190 --> 01:30:06,680
- No way. Man alive!
- What?

1075
01:30:06,930 --> 01:30:09,260
Are you telling me
you honestly don't see that?

1076
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:10,360
No. See what?

1077
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:13,370
I think they're using the satellite dishes
on the tops of the buildings

1078
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:16,100
to direct and amplify
the electromagnetic energy.

1079
01:30:16,140 --> 01:30:17,770
All right, we're pulling over.
We're pulling over.

1080
01:30:22,340 --> 01:30:24,210
Becky, I need you to do me a favor.

1081
01:30:24,650 --> 01:30:27,880
I need you to go up
to the very top of that thing.

1082
01:30:29,250 --> 01:30:30,340
Great.

1083
01:30:30,450 --> 01:30:33,790
You got to move that antenna
and just disrupt the signal.

1084
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:35,520
Okay. Right.

1085
01:30:37,130 --> 01:30:38,530
Hey, Becky.

1086
01:30:38,830 --> 01:30:41,730
Do you remember that letter I wrote
when we were 10 years old?

1087
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:42,890
Friend or girlfriend?

1088
01:30:43,270 --> 01:30:45,700
I never saw what you checked,

1089
01:30:46,700 --> 01:30:48,640
so in case I die tonight,
could you please tell me?

1090
01:30:50,510 --> 01:30:51,670
Don't die and I'll tell you.

1091
01:30:53,210 --> 01:30:55,180
Oh, yeah, okay.

1092
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:30,600
Balthazar.

1093
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:37,850
- Enough of your old tricks, Balthazar.
- As you wish.

1094
01:31:47,060 --> 01:31:50,930
Time was, things were pretty even
between us, Balthazar.

1095
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:53,270
As you can see,

1096
01:31:54,570 --> 01:31:56,900
I've acquired some new jewelry.

1097
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:03,270
I'm coming, buddy.
I'm coming. I'm coming.

1098
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:08,740
All right, what... What is this?
What am I looking at? No!

1099
01:32:10,890 --> 01:32:13,410
And a walker. Of course she has a...

1100
01:32:14,090 --> 01:32:15,560
Okay.

1101
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:18,590
Oh, boy.

1102
01:32:21,260 --> 01:32:26,700
A matador gored by a bull
can take up to three days to die.

1103
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:29,900
Sounds unpleasant, doesn't it?

1104
01:33:16,790 --> 01:33:18,510
The circle is nearly complete.

1105
01:33:18,990 --> 01:33:21,010
It must be awful, Balthazar.

1106
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:24,520
All these years,
fighting to stop this one moment

1107
01:33:25,190 --> 01:33:26,890
and then coming up short.

1108
01:34:06,370 --> 01:34:07,390
That's my car.

1109
01:34:24,390 --> 01:34:25,610
Oh!

1110
01:34:25,650 --> 01:34:26,810
Thank you!

1111
01:34:37,470 --> 01:34:38,520
We're too late.

1112
01:34:56,890 --> 01:34:57,980
Veronica.

1113
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:03,620
Is she...

1114
01:35:06,130 --> 01:35:07,600
They're both still with us.

1115
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:38,620
Balthazar, what have you done?

1116
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:41,160
What you did for me.

1117
01:35:45,230 --> 01:35:47,000
- Remember your promise.
- Balthazar, no.

1118
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:49,370
You'll do whatever it takes
to destroy Morgana.

1119
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:53,210
No. No, I can't.
I won't lock you in this thing.

1120
01:35:53,410 --> 01:35:54,840
Neither will I.

1121
01:35:56,010 --> 01:35:57,380
How sweet.

1122
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:10,880
Oh, man.

1123
01:36:13,900 --> 01:36:16,870
- And now we end this.
- No!

1124
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:23,830
No way.

1125
01:36:29,980 --> 01:36:31,070
No ring.

1126
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:32,710
It is you.

1127
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:34,380
The Prime Merlinean!

1128
01:36:37,650 --> 01:36:38,850
Fools!

1129
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:42,220
Veronica!

1130
01:36:51,430 --> 01:36:52,630
Now it's my turn.

1131
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,340
Is that the best that you can do?

1132
01:37:04,850 --> 01:37:05,940
I sure hope not.

1133
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:27,590
And now it's my turn.

1134
01:37:51,490 --> 01:37:52,590
Come on.

1135
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:00,260
Climb.

1136
01:38:04,310 --> 01:38:06,570
You have Merlin's powers,

1137
01:38:06,910 --> 01:38:09,710
but you don't have his strength
or his skill.

1138
01:38:09,850 --> 01:38:11,610
You are still weak.

1139
01:38:12,550 --> 01:38:13,740
But I'm not alone.

1140
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:17,180
I brought a little science with me. Now!

1141
01:39:02,260 --> 01:39:04,930
I did it! Balthazar, I actually did it!

1142
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:17,410
He's gone.

1143
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:23,650
He completed his quest.

1144
01:39:26,190 --> 01:39:30,180
No, no, no, no.
It's not over. He can't die.

1145
01:39:30,690 --> 01:39:32,960
I just... Not now.

1146
01:39:36,370 --> 01:39:37,630
Come on.

1147
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:57,850
That's not good enough.

1148
01:40:00,720 --> 01:40:03,160
Veronica, would you please step back?

1149
01:40:03,890 --> 01:40:07,090
If Morgana can stop his heart,
maybe I can start it.

1150
01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:16,270
All right, here we go, bud.
Here we go. Listen.

1151
01:40:16,310 --> 01:40:19,670
You... You with all your stupid rules!

1152
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:22,300
And all those old man shoes.

1153
01:40:22,340 --> 01:40:25,040
And your constantly saving me
with that look in your eyes.

1154
01:40:25,510 --> 01:40:26,780
Come on!

1155
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:28,680
Come on!

1156
01:40:29,620 --> 01:40:30,810
Come on.

1157
01:40:32,550 --> 01:40:33,950
Come on.

1158
01:40:46,940 --> 01:40:48,530
I had a dream.

1159
01:40:51,610 --> 01:40:55,770
You were insulting me, Dave.
Repeatedly.

1160
01:40:56,510 --> 01:40:59,480
Me? That's pretty weird, huh?

1161
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:02,850
No, kind of makes sense.

1162
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:04,010
Yeah.

1163
01:41:08,620 --> 01:41:11,090
- Thank you.
- Welcome back, old man.

1164
01:41:12,330 --> 01:41:13,760
You're here.

1165
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:38,250
Dave!

1166
01:41:42,620 --> 01:41:46,060
- You did it!
- I know. And I'm still alive.

1167
01:41:46,090 --> 01:41:48,360
And, surprisingly, so am I.

1168
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:51,700
I know. Oh, the note. Right.

1169
01:41:51,900 --> 01:41:53,700
- Friend or girlfriend?
- I don't care.

1170
01:41:59,540 --> 01:42:01,870
Girlfriend. Definitely girlfriend.

1171
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:11,010
Would you like to have breakfast
with me? In France?

1172
01:42:11,650 --> 01:42:12,710
France?

1173
01:42:16,260 --> 01:42:17,950
Yeah, I got us a ride.

1174
01:42:18,760 --> 01:42:20,590
Okay, you're fun.

1175
01:42:26,170 --> 01:42:29,540
Becky, there's something I forgot
to mention to you.

1176
01:42:29,570 --> 01:42:32,540
I really have no idea
how to land this thing.
